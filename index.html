<h1>Hola, Iâ€™m Cesar Aguirre! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p class="lead">Iâ€™m a software engineer, lifelong learner, language enthusiast, and avid reader.</p>

<p>I work remotely from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ (not Columbia) as a C# backend engineer and technical writer.</p>

<p>In over 10 years of working as a software engineer, I've seen and written bad code. And I have changed my mind about comments, method length, and Clean Code.</p>

<p>I'm not passionate anymore. I'm lazy. Once, the VP of Engineering at a client company I was working with called me "lazy"â€”as a compliment. That's the best one I've received.</p>

<p>Everybody brags about their achievements, but here are some of my failures:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2025/01/14/BeingFired/" target="_blank">I was fired from my first coding job.</a></li>
<li><a href="/2024/05/27/ApplyingToFaang/" target="_blank">I failed the interview process at a FAANG.</a></li>
<li>I once crashed a database server with a poorly written query.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably I ran a DELETE statement without filtering it first, but I can't remember. And I've introduced (and fixed) so many bugs I can't remember them either.</p>

<p>But I've learned valuable lessons from all those experiences.</p>

<p>And that's what I write about here on <a href="/blog">my blog</a>.</p>
