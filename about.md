I'm Cesar Aguirre. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/canro91), lifelong learner, language enthusiast and vivid reader.

### What I do

I’m a software engineer based in Colombia (_not Columbia_) with more than 6 years of experience. I work remotely as a C# backend engineer. I specialize in building APIs and backend code with .NET technologies. Mostly, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET Web API and SQL Server these days.

<div class="message lead"><em>I help teams to grow high-quality backend software through clean code and unit testing</em></div>

### What I've done

I have worked in public services, electronic invoicing and reservation management.

In electronic invoicing, I updated a platform to comply with the latest regulations from the Colombian government. Existing users continued to work with the least amount of breaking changes. Among other things,

* I changed document creation to follow the latest standard for XML business documents.
* I created a library to parse pdf's and plain-text files into xml files to feed a documents API.

### Fun facts

I’m a cat owner, [vim user]({% post_url 2020-09-14-LearnVimForFunAndProfit %}), [plain-text lover]({% post_url 2020-08-29-HowITakeNotes %}) and [Zettelkasten practitioner]({% post_url 2020-11-18-HowToTakeSmartNotes %}).

In my free time, I like to read books (_on paper_) and learn and teach foreign languages. 

### What I write about

I write about learning and programming. I want to share what I have learned in my journey as a software engineer.

In this blog you can find tips and advice, libraries I have used, issues I have found, lessons learned the hard way, success and failure stories.

If you're interested, you can read [how I started blogging]({% post_url 2020-07-18-HowIStartedBlogging %}) and the story behind my first post.
