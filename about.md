I'm Cesar Aguirre. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/canro91), lifelong learner, language enthusiast and vivid reader.

I wrote [Parsinator](https://github.com/canro91/Parsinator), a library to extract relevant data from text-based pdfs and plain-text files. From time to time, I contribute to OSS by opening issues and sending pull request to the libraries and projects I use. I have contributed to [DateTimeExtensions](https://github.com/joaomatossilva/DateTimeExtensions) adding holidays for my country.

I'm passionate about learning and programming, in general. I want to share what I have learned in my journey as a software engineer.

Thanks for reading!
