I'm Cesar Aguirre. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/canro91), lifelong learner, [language enthusiast]({% post_url 2020-10-23-ThreeLanguageLessons %}) and vivid reader.

## What I do

I’m a software engineer based in Colombia _(not Columbia)_ with more than 10 years of experience _(I stopped counting)_. I work remotely as a backend engineer and technical writer. I specialize in building APIs and backend code with .NET technologies. Mainly [C#](/tags/csharp), [ASP.NET Core](/tags/asp.net), and [SQL Server](/tags/sql) these days.

<div class="message lead"><em>I help teams grow high-quality backend code. And by high-quality, I mean maintainable and performant.</em></div>

## What I've done

I have worked in public services, electronic invoicing, and reservation management.

In electronic invoicing, I updated a platform to comply with the latest regulations from the Colombian government. Existing users continued to work with the least amount of breaking changes. Among other things,

* I changed document creation to follow the latest standard for XML business documents.
* I created a library to parse PDFs and plain-text files into XML files to feed a documents API.

## What I write about

I write about learning and programming. I want to share what I have learned in my journey as a software engineer. Often, I consider my blog as [my own time capsule]({% post_url 2020-07-20-TimeCapsule %}).

In this blog, you can find tips and advice, libraries I use, issues I have solved, lessons learned the hard way, success and failure stories.

I've been featured in <a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/author/cesar-aguirre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exception Not Found</a> as a Guest Writer. And, I've written for SaaS companies like <a href="https://www.alachisoft.com/blogs/author/cesar-aguirre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alachisoft</a>.

## Fun facts

I’m a ~~cat owner,~~ [vim user]({% post_url 2020-09-14-LearnVimForFunAndProfit %}), [plain-text lover]({% post_url 2020-08-29-HowITakeNotes %}), and [Zettelkasten practitioner]({% post_url 2020-11-18-HowToTakeSmartNotes %}).

In my free time, I like to read books _(on paper)_ and learn foreign languages. Currenlty, I'm learning Brazilian Portuguese. _(Oi, gente! Tudo bem?)_
