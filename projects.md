I wrote [Parsinator](https://github.com/canro91/Parsinator), a library to extract relevant data from text-based pdfs and plain-text files. I used Parsinator to connect 4 legacy client softwares to a document API by parsing pdfs and plain text files to input xml files. Also, I wrote [BaseXml](https://github.com/canro91/BaseXml) to manipulate and validate xml files. I used BaseXml to enrich nodes and read values from standard XML business documents, [UBL files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Business_Language).

From time to time, I contribute to OSS by opening issues and sending pull requests to the libraries and projects I use. I have contributed to [DateTimeExtensions](https://github.com/joaomatossilva/DateTimeExtensions) adding holidays for my country, for example.

This is some of the code I have written. Feel free to take a look, report any bug, ask for a new feature or send a pull-request.
