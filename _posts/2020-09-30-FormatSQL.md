description: The lazy way to format your SQL queries. Learn how to format your SQL queries with two free tools
---

Do you need to format your SQL queries? Are you doing it by hand? Stop! There is a better way!

Instead of formatting SQL queries to follow code conventions by hand, you can use online tools or extensions inside Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio or any other text editor.

These are two free tools to format SQL queries and store procedures. Inside Notepad++, use **Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter**. And, **ApexSQL Refactor** for Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio.

## Before

Before using Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter and ApexSQL Refactor, I spent too much time formatting queries by hand. It means making keywords uppercase, aligning columns and arranging spaces.

I tried to use "Find and Replace" inside an editor. But, it only worked for making keywords uppercase. Sometimes I ended up messing with variables, parameters or any other thing inside my queries.

Things were worse with long store procedures. I changed two lines and I ended up formatting thousand of lines. _"Once you touch it, you're the owner"_.

## A sample query from StackOverflow

Let's format the query to [find StackOverflow posts with many "thank you" answers](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/886/posts-with-many-thank-you-answers).

```sql
select
   ParentId as [Post Link],
   count(id)
from posts
where posttypeid = 2 and len(body) <= 200
  and (body like '%hank%')
group by parentid
having count(id) > 1
order by count(id) desc;
```

After formatting the query to follow [Simon Holywell SQL Style Guide](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/), it should like this

```sql
SELECT ParentId AS [Post Link]
     , COUNT(id)
  FROM posts
 WHERE posttypeid = 2
   AND LEN(body) <= 200
   AND (body LIKE '%hank%')
 GROUP BY parentid
HAVING COUNT(id) > 1
 ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC;
```

Let's see how these two tools format our sample query.

### Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter

[Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter](https://github.com/TaoK/PoorMansTSqlFormatter) is a free and open source .NET and JavaScript library to format your SQL queries. It's available for Notepad++, Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio and others. You can try its formatting options [online](http://poorsql.com/) too.

This is how Poor Man's T-SQL format our sample query in Notepad++.

It doesn't make function names uppercase. Notice the functions `len` and `count`.

Also, it indents `AND` clauses in the `WHERE` clause. I want them right-aligned to the previous `WHERE`. But, it's a good starting point.

Sometimes, it needs a bit of help if the query has single-line comments in it with `--`.

By the way, it's better to use `/* */` for single-line comments inside our queries and store procedures. This makes formatting easier when you copy queries or statements from plan cache.

### ApexSQL Refactor

[ApexSQL Refactor](https://www.apexsql.com/sql-tools-refactor.aspx) is a free query formatter for Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio. It has over 160 formatting options. You can create your own formattig profiles and preview them. It comes with four built-in profiles. Also, you can try it [online](https://sql-formatter.online/options/formatting).

This is how ApexSQL Refactor format our sample query in Visual Studio 2019.

It isn't perfect either. But, it makes functions uppercase. Point for ApexSQL Refactor.

Also, it indents `AND` clauses in the `WHERE` too. I couldn't find an option to change it. But, there is an option to indent `ON` in `SELECT` statements with `JOIN`. It affects `ON` for index creation too. We can live with that.

Voil√†! Please, save you some time formatting your SQL queries with any of these two free tools. For other alternatives, check [this SQLShack collection of formatter tools](https://www.sqlshack.com/sql-formatter-tools/).
