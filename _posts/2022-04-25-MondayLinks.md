## Toxic Culture Is Driving the Great Resignation

I have read a couple of times about the Great Resignation. I guess the world isn't the place after the pandemic. And that is reflected in the job market too. _"A toxic corporate culture is the single best predictor of which companies suffered from high attrition in the first six months of the Great Resignation."_ [Read full article](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/)

## What's in a Good Error Message?

I don't know how many times I have debugged the "The given key was not present in the dictionary" error. In fact, I wrote [two C# idioms]({% post_url 2020-08-01-AnotherTwoCSharpIdiomsPart3 %}) to avoid exceptions when working with dictionaries. From the article, to write better error messages: give context, show the actual error, and tell how to mitigate it. [Read full article](https://www.morling.dev/blog/whats-in-a-good-error-message/)

## Why don't I have a blog?

I have always heard: "start your own blog." Well, I started my own blog...you're reading it. But this is a post about the opposite: why not have a blog. The author points out is that posts only rephrase Reddit or StackOverflow's comments. But, I learned from [Show Your Work]({% post_url 2020-10-01-ShowYourWorkTakeaways %}) that nothing is completely original. We all have some sort of inspiration. And, precisely that, and our own voice make our blogs unique. [Read full article](https://fede.dm/blog/)

## Learn By Wrapping

The best advice to learn something is to [learn by doing]({% post_url 2020-05-07-PragmaticThinkingAndLearning %}). Finding project ideas is often difficult. Another TODO app, really? This article shares a learning activity: Write a wrapper for a library or an API you're already familiar with. Instead of jumping to the documentation, start writing a wrapper in the language you want to learn. [Read full article](https://mikerourke.dev/blog/learn-by-wrapping/)

## Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never Ignore a Recruiter

These days, anyone with a LinkedIn profile and "Software engineer" in the headline is getting lots of spam messages and connection requests. I bet you already got a message between these lines: "Hi X, I have one company interested in your profile. Are you available for a quick call to share more details? Please, send me your CV at this email."

This article shares a template to reply back to these spammy messages. If you use it, you will be asking for a company name, seniority, and compensation before starting any conversation. That would be enough feedback for recruiters too. [Read full article](https://index.medium.com/career-advice-nobody-gave-me-never-ignore-a-recruiter-4474eac9556)
