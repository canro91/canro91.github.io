Imagine writing a blog post every day for over 20 years.

Seth Godin has done just that. A post a day for over 20 years means more than 7,000 daily blog posts. That's more than impressive. I've always admired Seth's blogging rhythm.

Inspired by Seth Godin and other daily writers like Tim Denning and [Herbert Lui]({% post_url 2024-09-16-LessonsFromHerbertLuiBlog %}), I started writing daily on my blog in November 2024. I even created a new tag, [/misc](/tags/misc), for everything outside of software engineering and coding. That's part of my [strategy in these days of dead blogging]({% post_url 2025-01-27-TimesOfDeadBlogging %}).

For my daily writing challenge, one headline and one main idea are enough to call it a day. No cover image. No need for 10 points. If it's longer than a tweet, it's OK to publish. Around 200 words is my sweet spot.

A daily writing habit has made me more conscious of the content I consume.

When we set the intention to write daily, [we start to see content everywhere]({% post_url 2025-01-26-ContentIsEverywhere %}): conversations, quotes, passages from books, podcast episodes, comments on social media, TV shows..."Oh, that could be a post, I'd better write down that idea."

My goal was to publish 100 daily posts starting on November 1st. This is my daily post #100. Mission accomplished.
