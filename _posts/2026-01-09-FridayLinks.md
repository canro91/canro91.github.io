Hey, there!

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** AI makes coding and shipping nearly free. [Side projects alone won't help you stand out](https://medium.com/@iamalvisng/your-side-project-wont-save-you-anymore-ca997028227e?sk=d56cf519b83e4d1081a0014b2555d401) (7min). Maybe it's time to double down on open source contributions or start a "learn and build in public" YouTube channel.

**#2.** Addy Osmani, a leader at Google, shared [21 lessons after a decade of coding](https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/) (10min). The one that resonated the most? #6. _"Coding doesn't advocate for you."_ Good code alone doesn't make you a good coder, especially in the AI era.

**#3.** AI shows coding isn't the bottleneck. A concept that isn't new. Here's a breakdown of why [it's never been the bottleneck](https://blog.robbowley.net/2026/01/05/coding-has-never-been-the-bottleneck/) (6min).

**#4.** Maybe juniors won't say the same, but [it's a great time to be a coder](https://zarar.dev/its-a-great-time-to-be-a-software-engineer/) (5min). Our job may be to design systems and let AI fill in the blanks. (That's point #10 from that post)

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the "hiring is broken" law of coding blogs]({% post_url 2026-01-06-HiringIsBrokenLaw %}) (2min) and [the mantra to thrive in the AI era]({% post_url 2026-01-05-Mantra %}) (2min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... my new book, _Street-Smart Coding_: 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

Happy coding in 2026!

See you next time,

Cesar
