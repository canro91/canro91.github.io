Today I found a post claiming you're not a senior software engineer until you work on a legacy app.

It made me think about when we can call ourselves programmers.

## From me:

So, you're not a programmer until:
1. You write a to-do app or a recipe catalog
2. You google [how to become a better coder]({% post_url 2025-03-08-TipsForNewCoders %})
3. You have an interview with a clueless recruiter
4. You copy and paste a code block from StackOverflow
5. You take down a database server with a badly written query
6. You read [the Clean Code]({% post_url 2020-01-06-CleanCodeReview %}) and want to rewrite all the code around you
7. You debug using `Console.WriteLine` or `console.log` or `printf`
8. You get a PM asking you how you're doing more than once a day
9. You google your error message and find an open issue on GitHub
10. You delete a database table with a DELETE without WHERE
11. You argue about a variable name during a code review
12. You write a class `Person` when learning about OOP
13. You code a calculator app using JavaScript
14. You work on a full rewrite of a legacy app
15. You google how to center a div on a webpage

## From my friends and ex-coworkers:

I asked some of my friends and ex-coworkers to complete that sentence. And here's what they told me.

You're not a programmer until...

1. You write your first "Hello, world" program
2. You stay awake until 3:00 AM solving a coding issue
3. You're fixing an issue, it works and you don't know why
4. Your code works on your machine, but not in Production
5. You get a compilation error on line 123 on a 40-line code file
6. You deploy a hotfix to Production at 17:55 (and you clock out at 18:00)

## From dev.to:

I reposted this on [dev.to](https://dev.to/canro91/youre-not-a-programmer-until-58i) and here are my favorites from the comments. (Slightly edited to make them fit in one line) 

You're not a programmer until...

1. You've programmed
2. You use `git push --force --all`
3. You say "Well, it works in Dev"
4. You have a folder of unfinished projects
5. You build a collection of most-used code snippets
6. You set your git username to "User" so they can't blame you
7. You use `git reset --hard` or delete your local repo and clone it again
8. [You start a blog]({% post_url 2025-04-10-TilPosts %}) to share your learning to save others debugging time
9. [You're stuck on a bug]({% post_url 2020-09-19-ThreeDebuggingTips %}) and your code works when you call a senior for help
10. You've spent time installing [your favorite editor/IDE's plugins and themes]({% post_url 2019-06-28-MyVSSetupSharpeningTheAxe %})
11. You feel stupid by constantly trying to learn things you do not know what they're for

And you're not truly a coder until you grab a copy of my book, _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding_.

OK, jokes aside, for so long I thought coding was only about cracking symbols. But I had to learn coding is a wide range of skills like surviving on-call rotations, talking to non-tech managers, and many more I included in my book.

_[Grab your copy of Street-Smart Coding here](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding)_â€”That's the roadmap I wish I had when I was starting out.
