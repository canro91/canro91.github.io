title: "Two Steps I Missed When Writing Street-Smart Coding"

Ever had that moment after turning in an exam when all the answers suddenly hit you? Too late!

OK, something similar has happened after launching [Street-Smart Coding]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}), my latest book.

I've realized I missed two key actions before writing and launching it:

## #1. Write a one-liner.

Writing a book is hard. But summarizing it into one line is harder.

[That one-liner]({% post_url 2025-11-09-OneLine %}) makes marketing easier.

This week I discovered Jose Saramago's The Stone Raft. Its one-liner? "One day, quite inexplicably, the Iberian Peninsula simply breaks free from the European continent and begins to drift as if it were a sort of stone raft." Boom! Who doesn't want to read the book after that?

That's a fiction book. But the principle applies to non-fiction too.

## #2. Follow the "same but different" framework.

Salwa Emerson, an author and ghostwriter, shared the "same but different" framework in a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salwa-emerson_if-you-cant-answer-this-then-youre-not-activity-7398722130047119360-oky3).

The goal is to answer, "My book is the same as _\<insert book\>_, but different because _\<reason\>_."

Again, this comes from traditional publishing, where books are placed next to hits. Hits show there's market demand for the topic. But we can follow it for non-fiction too.

And applied to my book: _Street-Smart Coding is like The Pragmatic Programmer but different because it covers soft, unexpected skills in a choose-your-own-adventure style._
