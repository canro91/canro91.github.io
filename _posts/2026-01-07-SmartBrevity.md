title: "Six Lessons to Say More With Fewer Words—Using Smart Brevity"

As writers, your job is to adapt to how your readers consume words.

**Why this matters:** Content is free and abundant. We are drowning in emails, Slack messages, and beeps and buzzes. In seconds, we decide to read or keep scrolling.

A wall of text makes us stop reading. [I learned that the hard way]({% post_url 2025-09-28-TooLong %}). And you and I do the same.

**We don't read, but skim.**

Deliver fast. Say more with fewer words. That's the big idea behind _Smart Brevity,_ the digital version of the classic _Elements of Style_.

## Here are six lessons to apply Smart Brevity:

**#1. The one idea test.** Start writing the one thing you want readers to know. Put it front and center. Then ask someone else if they can find it.

**#2. Use headline, strong first line, "why," and "go deeper."**
* Don't make people choose what's important. You tell them.
* Tell readers what your piece is about and if it's for them.
* Use key phrases to guide skimmers. Phrases like _"why this matters,"_ _"the big picture,"_ or _"backstory."_

In [Mastery]({% post_url 2026-01-03-Mastery %}), Robert Greene used "Understand" to introduce big ideas. That's a visual clue for skimmers.

**#3. The bar & beach test.** Write like a human. Don't use any word you wouldn't use in a bar or on the beach. No more _"Dear LinkedIn network, I'm pleased to announce..."_

**#4. The "would you read it?" test.** Once you're done, ask yourself: _"Would I read it if I hadn't written it?"_ If not, why do you think someone else will?

**#5. For email subject lines:**
* Use 6 words and prefer one-syllable words.
* Emojis make your subject lines stand out.

**#6. For presentations:**
* Start and end with _"if you remember one thing from this, ..."_
* Use 5 or 6 slides and one point per slide.

For fiction, we want authors to take us to new, imaginary worlds. But for emails, presentations, and social media posts, we need shorter, clear text. Even in non-fiction, why make readers flip through pages for one points? Brevity always wins!
