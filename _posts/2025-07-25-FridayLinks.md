Hey, there.

I thought I wouldn't find another 4 since [last Wednesday email]({% post_url 2025-07-23-WednesdayLinks %}). Here are 4 links for you today: (I couldn't avoid adding the last one, not about coding though)

#1. The whole point of AI is making coders faster. But [here's an study](https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-slows-down-some-experienced-software-developers-study-finds-2025-07-10/) (4min) that shows AI makes some experienced developers slower.

#2. Sure, AI is the buzzword these days. But [there are things that don't change](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/07/14/what-doesnt-change/) (4min). "AI amplifies what you already know."

#3. Something we coders should learn from pilots? [The value of checklists](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ChecklistsAreHardButGood) (3min). 

#4. This one isn't about coding, but... I found out there's an official list of cocktails and [a guy who drank them all](https://aaronson.org/blog/i-drank-every-cocktail) (20min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [how to stand out from AI content]({% post_url 2025-07-20-StandOutFromAI %}) (2min) and [the simple method I use to replace my second brain]({% post_url 2025-06-22-SimplerNoteTaking %}) (2min).
