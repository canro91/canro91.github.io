Did you join Software Engineering because you liked coding and time alone? Think again.

You'll spend more time in meetings than coding:
* Daily stand-ups
* 1-on-1s
* Team retros
* Five minutes (that become hours) with another dev revisiting code you wrote a year ago, and you barely remember it

With all these interactions, technical skills alone aren't enough. You need strong communication skills.

The best resource for that? _How to Win Friends and Influence People._ Newer books exist, but this one is a true classic.

Here are two ideas from that book that changed how I approach conversations at work:

## Never, ever, ever tell anyone they're wrong.

That's the worst way to start or end a conversation. And you won't change the other person's mind.

At a previous job, I had the chance to apply that principle.

We were working to connect our hotel solution to a third-party API using the PKCE flow. One developers read an outdated tutorial and wanted to implement it incorrectly.

If I hadn't read the book, I would have said, _"You're wrong. Here's how to do it... You, moron!"_ OK, I would have only thought the last part.

But instead I said something like, _"Hey, maybe I read an outdated tutorial or something. Here's what I found..."_ A few moments later, I got a "You're right!" with a facepalm emoji.

Avoid blaming. Instead, pretend you're the one who might be wrong. 

## Be careful with your "but."

Often what comes after a "but" is something negative.

And people remember more the last words they hear. So if your "but" comes last, that's all what they will remember.

_"That's a good idea, but we will go over budget"_ is different from _"That's a good idea, and if we stay within budget, it'll be perfect."_

Find ways to replace your "no, but..." with a "yes, and..."

Ten years ago, I thought coding was just cracking symbols. It took me years to learn coding is also about being in countless calls and sync-ups: negotiating deadlines and sharing expectations with non-tech people.

That's why working on our communication skills is one of the 30 proven strategies in my book, _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding._ That's the roadmap I wish I had when I was starting out.
