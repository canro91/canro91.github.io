title: "Two Tiny Fixes That Could Transform Your Communication at Work"

I've only reread a few books. One of them, _How to Win Friends and Influence People_.

There may be newer books on communication, but this one has stood the test of time.

Here are two ideas from that book that changed how I approach conversations at work:

## Never, ever, ever tell anyone they're wrong.

That's the worst way to start or end a conversation. And you won't change the other person's mind.

Instead of blaming anyone, find something else to blame or pretend to be clueless by saying you are the one who might be wrong. _"Hey maybe I'm reading the wrong documentation. Here it says..."_

## Be careful with your "but."

Often what comes next to a "but" is something negative.

People often remember the last words they hear, so they will only remember the negative part. Find ways to replace your "no, but."

_"That's a good idea, but we will go over budget"_ is different from _"That's a good idea, and if we stay within budget, it'll be perfect."_
