I'm jumping into the online conversation about blogging expectations.

I found out about it on [joelchrono's blog](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/blogging-expectations/). But somebody else started it. I can't find those initial posts anymore.

## Here's what I expected from my blog

I started blogging to improve my coding.

That's what Google recommended and I bought the idea. So [in 2018, I started blogging]({% post_url 2020-07-18-HowIStartedBlogging %}) to document my learning as a coder and the problems I was solving at work.

A couple of years after my first post, I added analytics with [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/). And to my surprise, some people read my posts. Thanks, Google!

Then to increase my pageviews, I started to repost on [dev.to](https://dev.to/canro91) and to share my posts on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/iamcesaraguirre). That was the strategy I found to increase my blog traffic.

So I was writing:
* To document my journey,
* To please the SEO gods,
* To rank on Google first page, and
* To have people reading my posts.

I started with no plans, just to improve my coding skills. But I discovered SEO and [a love for writing](/tags/writing/).

## Blogging has given me a few moments of attention

Since then, [my blog has done more for my career than a portfolio]({% post_url 2025-01-12-BlogVsPortfolio %}).

Apart from occasional virality and a bit of lunch money, my blog led to unexpected results:

* Getting my blog curated on [Minifeed]({% post_url 2025-03-27-IndieWebAndMinifeed %})
* People on Reddit roasting one of my posts
* A reader compiling his favorite posts from my blog
* [One of my blogging heroes]({% post_url 2024-09-16-LessonsFromHerbertLuiBlog %}) reacting to one of my posts
* An interview going faster after I showed my unit testing posts
* [One veteran coder emailing me]({% post_url 2025-02-24-AVeteranOnAI %}) after one of my posts going viral
* Readers emailing me to point typos or issues in my code samples
* One reader emailing me to share how one of my posts resonated with them
* Another writing hero tagging me in one of his posts after a discussion in the comments

Those unexpected moments showed me that my writing resonated with people. Sometimes I'm not writing into the void.

Even if [I had to start over]({% post_url 2025-06-10-StartingFromZero %}), I'd still blog. For [my mental health and creativity]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}). And yes, for a bit of attention.
