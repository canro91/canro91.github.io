Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** This week, another major Internet outage. This time at Cloudflare. It raises the question: [do we really need Cloudflare?](https://huijzer.xyz/posts/123/do-not-put-your-site-behind-cloudflare-if-you-dont) (2min).

**#2.** Maybe it's time to migrate to GNU/Linux. Because [Windows 11 is adding an AI agent](https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/11/18/windows-11-to-add-an-ai-agent-that-runs-in-background-with-access-to-personal-folders-warns-of-security-risk/) (8min) with access to personal folders. 

**#3.** Imagine all the trouble you'll face online if [you had a single-letter name](https://viewfromthewing.com/his-legal-name-is-one-letter-the-airline-rejects-it-and-says-just-call-yourself-aa-creating-chaos/) (6min). Airlines won't sell you a ticket, and another name won't match your passport. Keep this in mind next time you're working on validating web forms.

**#4.** Faster code isn't always better. Working at a startup makes you [optimize your code for different things](https://geek.sg/blog/optimizing) (2min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [some hard truths about coding they don't teach you]({% post_url 2025-11-20-HardTruths %}) (2min) and [the skill that took my career further than anything else]({% post_url 2025-11-19-TheOneSkill %}) (2min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... [Street-Smart Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=friday-links-singleletter-names-windows-optimization): 30 lessons to help you code like a pro, from Googling to clear communication. It's the roadmap I wish I had moving from junior to senior and the one I hope helps you too. 


See you next time,

Cesar
