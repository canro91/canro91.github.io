Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. I was wrong to think I had to point out everything "wrong" at work. I had good intentions. But it only gave me a reputation as someone problematic. Stay away from negativity. That's [this developer's best career advice](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/06/20/career.html) (4min)

#2. I have never used Git Notes. Yes, that's a Git feature. But it seems to be [the coolest and most unloved Git feature](https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2022/11/19/git-notes-gits-coolest-most-unloved-feature/) (5min)

#3. I don't think I've ever "hated" one of my managers. And I've had managers who were amazing and some who didn't know what they were doing. But here's [why we engineers (sometimes) hate our managers](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/06/24/why-engineers-hate-their-managers-and-what-to-do-about-it/) (7min).

#4. Despite all Internet advice about surviving the AI trend, [we should stop getting good at ChatGPT](https://daedtech.com/surviving-the-great-commoditizer-stop-getting-good-at-chatgpt/) (20min). Because _to get "good" at using ChatGPT to execute your tradecraft is thus to get good at commoditizing your own labor and your craft._

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [how to split an array into odd pairs (an interview exercise)]({% post_url 2025-06-26-OddPairs %}) (6min) and [some ideas to avoid being ghosted when emailing busy people]({% post_url 2025-06-21-ColdEmail %}) (3min).
