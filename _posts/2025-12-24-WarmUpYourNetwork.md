Your professional network is one of your greatest career assets.

Most job opportunities aren't on job boards. They come through favors and phone calls. I know because [I've found almost all my jobs]({% post_url 2025-01-14-BeingFired %}) by knowing someone who knows someone.

But don't [wait for a layoff]({% post_url 2024-12-05-HowALayoffFeels %}) to reach out for help.

The holiday season is a good time to "warm up" your connections. This season is for sharing greetings, postcards, and gifts.

Send a quick hello to old connections: bosses, coworkers. Don't ask for favors or worse, sell something. Just a casual "how are you" followed by "Merry Christmas" or "Happy New Year." You can even use the same message for everyone.

You will surprise them and they'll keep you top of mind.
