It seems we're still far away from the dream of only using English as the new programming language.

Today I found this video from Coding Garden:

He quit AI coding mainly for two reasons:

**#1.** He complained that AI has stolen all the joy of figuring things out by himself. No more aha moments using AI.

**#2.** And even after crafting the "perfect" prompts, he found LLM's output is unreliable. AI comments test out to "make them pass," writes passing tests by tweaking edge cases...

LLMs aren't really like a fast junior coder. They're more like a lazy, sloppy, stubborn junior coder who suddenly needs to be taught again.

I don't swear by English as the de facto programming language. I still want to figure out tricky bugs on my own. I want to design the building blocks of code. I don't want AI to kill the fun part. [I don't want AI to take away my coding skills]({% post_url 2025-07-13-TheProblemWithAI %}). I just want AI to do the boring part: generate syntax once I've done the thinking part... and kill SCRUM in the process.

AI spits out code faster than any of us. But being a good coder isn't about syntax and lines of code. It's about problem-solving, debugging, and clear communication. And that's why I wrote _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding._ It's the roadmap I wish I had when I was starting out.
