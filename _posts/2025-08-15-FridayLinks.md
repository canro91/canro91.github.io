Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. One senior developer failed at a live coding interview session. Funny enough, once the interview was over, he solved the exercise. Arrggg! He wrote a breakdown of [why live coding sucks](https://hadid.dev/posts/living-coding/) (9min).

#2. Here are [50 bits of career advice](https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/08/11/Fifty-Bits-of-Career-Advice/) (12min). Bit#26 is what I call "my code is not my baby."

#3. It's interesting to notice how coding has changed over the years. [Coding a spellchecker used to be a huge challenge](https://prog21.dadgum.com/29.html) (3min). These days we have plenty of memory, we don't really care anymore.

#4. This is a coder vs huge corporation story. He wrote a piece of code that a major AI corporation uses. But they rejected him when he applied to work there. He [gave AI arms and legs, then it rejected him](https://grell.dev/blog/ai_rejection) (7min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the one lesson I wish I'd known when I started coding]({% post_url 2025-08-13-OneCodingLesson %}) (2min) and [some C# extension methods I stole from Reddit]({% post_url 2025-08-09-ExtensionMethods %}) (3min).
