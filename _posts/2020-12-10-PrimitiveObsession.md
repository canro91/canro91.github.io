title: A case of primitive obsession. A real example in C#
tags: tutorial csharp

These days I was working with Stripe API to take payments. And I found a case of primitive obsession. Keep reading to learn how to get rid of it.

**Primitive obsession is when developers choose primitive types (strings, integers, decimals) to represent entities of the business domain. To solve this code smell, create classes to model the business entities and to enforce the appropriate business rules.**

## Using Stripe API

Stripe API uses units to represent amounts. All amounts are multiplied by 100. This is 1USD = 100 units. Also, we can only use amounts between $0.50 USD and $999,999.99 USD. This isn't the case for all currencies, but let's keep it simple. For more information, check [Stripe documentation for currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal).

The codebase I was working with used two extension methods on the `decimal` type to convert between amounts and units. Those two methods were something like `ToUnits()` and `ToAmount()`.

But, besides variable names, there wasn't anything preventing me to use a `decimal` instead of Stripe units. It was the same `decimal` type for both concepts. Anyone could forget to convert things and charge someone's credit card more than expected. Arggg!

## Getting rid of primitive obsession

### 1. Create a type alias

As an alternative to encode units of measure on variable names, we can use a type alias.

Let's declare a new type alias with `using Unit = System.Decimal` and change the correct parameters to use `Unit`. But, the compiler won't warn us if we pass `decimal` instead of `Unit`. See the snippet below.

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace GettingRidOfPrimitiveObsession
{
    using Unit = System.Decimal;

    [TestClass]
    public class ConvertBetweenAmountAndUnits
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void UseTypeAlias()
        {
            decimal amount = 100;
            Unit chargeAmount = amount.ToUnit();

            var paymentService = new PaymentService();
            paymentService.Pay(chargeAmount);

            paymentService.Pay(amount);
            // ^^^^ It compiles
        }
    }

    public class PaymentService
    {
        public void Pay(Unit amountToCharge)
        {
            // Magic goes here
        }
    }

    public static class DecimalExtensions
    {
        public static Unit ToUnits(this decimal d)
            => d * 100;
    }
}
```

Using a type alias is more expressive than encoding the unit of measure in variable names and parameters. But, it doesn't force us to use one type instead of the other.

With the `Unit` type alias, we can still, by mistake, pass regular decimals when we meant units.

Let's try a better alternative!

### 2. Create a new type

Now, let's create a `Unit` class and pass it around instead of `decimal`.

In the constructor of the new `Unit` class, let's check if the input amount is inside Stripe bounds. Also, let's use a method to convert units back to normal amounts.

```csharp
public class Unit
{
    internal decimal Value { get; }

    private Unit(decimal d)
    {
        if (d < 0.5m || d > 999_999.99m)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Amount outside of bounds");
        }

        Value = d * 100m;
    }

    public static Unit FromAmount(decimal d)
      => new Unit(d);

    public decimal ToAmount()
        => Value / 100m;
}
```

Notice, we made the constructor private and added a `FromAmount()` factory method for more readability.

After using a class instead of an alias, the compiler will warn us if we switch the two types by mistake. And, it's clear from a method signature if it works with amounts or units.

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void UseAType()
{
    decimal amount = 100;
    Unit chargeAmount = Unit.FromAmount(amount);

    var paymentService = new PaymentService();
    paymentService.Pay(chargeAmount);

    // paymentService.Pay(amount);
    // ^^^^ cannot convert from 'decimal' to 'GettingRidOfPrimitiveObsession.Unit'
}
```

If needed, we can overload the `+` and `-` operators to make sure we're not adding oranges and apples. Decimals and units, I mean.

[Records from C# 9.0]({% post_url 2021-09-13-TopNewCSharpFeatures %}) offer a shorter notation for classes to replace primitive values. Records have built-in memberwise comparison, `ToString()` methods and copy constructors, among other features.

We can use custom classes, like the `Unit` class we wrote, to encode restrictions, constraints, and business rules in our business domain. That's the main takeaway from [Domain Modeling Made Functional]({% post_url 2021-12-13-DomainModelingMadeFunctional %}).

Voil√†! That's how we can get rid of primitive obsession. A type alias was more expressive than encoding units of measure on names. But, a class was a better alternative. By the way, F# supports [unit of measures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/units-of-measure) to variables. And, the compiler will warn you if you forget to use the right unit of measure.
