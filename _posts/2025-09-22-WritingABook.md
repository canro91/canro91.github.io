I have a new writing challenge: I'm writing a book. One about [how to improve our coding skills]({% post_url 2025-09-21-30Ways %}).

I've had to [change my mind about writing books]({% post_url 2025-07-22-Books %}). I used to think I needed a 10,000-word, fully-researched book. But reading [21 Lessons for the 21st Century]({% post_url 2025-08-21-21Lessons %}) showed me that a book could be a compilation of scattered ideas.

Finishing the first draft is the beginning. Designing and selling it comes with their own challenges. Here are 7 lessons I've learned to design and sell a book so far:

## Interior design

**#1.** Start every new chapter on a right-hand page.

**#2.** You can design a book's interior with Word or Google Docs. But [Reedsy Studio](https://reedsy.com/studio/write-a-book) automates a lot of the boring tasks.

Interestingly, Reedsy only supports writing a book in English. You can change the spellchecker language, but I couldn't find a way to change the copyright notice and front matter. So we're back to Word for other languages.

**#3.** The copyright page is boilerplate you can find online. Reedsy does it for us with a few clicks.

**#4.** Write your author page in the third person.

**#5.** Invest in a professional cover design. People do judge a book by its cover. 

## Promoting and selling with Amazon

**#6.** Amazon doesn't require an ISBN for the Kindle and provides a free one for paperbacks. But you can't use it elsewhere.

**#7.** Pricing starting points:
* $0.99 is the new free
* $2.99 for the Kindle version
* $9.98 for the paperback version

**#8.** To follow Amazon's rules, you can ask for reviews inside your book. But you can't include external links to your book page.
