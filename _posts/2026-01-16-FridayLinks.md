Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** Curious about laptops 30 years ago? Here's [the "I checked my notebook" commercial](https://blog.hayman.net/2026/01/09/i-checked-my-notebook.html) (1min). My laptop wouldn't survive that.

**#2.** I've used StackOverflow (and still do), but never created an account or asked a question. Not a welcoming community. That's [why StackOverflow is dead](https://www.pcloadletter.dev/blog/abandoning-stackoverflow/) (3min). ChatGPT doesn't close your questions or downvote them.

**#3.** Meetings are the worst part of coding professionally. Especially those when the organizer is late, everybody waits...awkward silence...Here's [a quick hack to start meetings on time](https://philipotoole.com/start-your-meetings-at-5-minutes-past/) (2min).

**#4.** I keep seeing people online brag about coding without touching an editor or IDE. Now they "code" from their phones with Claude Code. Vibe coding was bad. But now coding outside an editor is good? That's the [vibe coding paradox](https://blog.kaplich.me/vibe-coding-paradox/) (2min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the books I read and the ones I didn't finish in 2025]({% post_url 2025-12-31-Books %}) (3min) and [why we should forget about LOCs to stand out]({% post_url 2026-01-04-CodeCantSpeak %}) (3min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... my new book, _Street-Smart Coding_: 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

See you next time,

Cesar
