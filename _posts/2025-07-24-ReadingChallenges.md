Adam Aaronson drank every cocktail on the official list.

Yes, there's an official list of cocktails. And [Adam drank them all](https://aaronson.org/blog/i-drank-every-cocktail). He started by handing the list to a bartender in his city and ended up at Satan's Whiskers in London. Yes, that's a bar.

Quite an impressive adventure.

Just like Adam tackled cocktails, what about book lovers? That story reminded me of [a 10-idea list]({% post_url 2025-06-17-TenIdeas %}) I wrote with 10 book reading challenges. If you want to try one, here they are:

1. Join a book reading club
2. Read the last 25 Pulitzer winners
3. Read the last 25 Nobel Prize winners
4. Read your favorite writer's complete works
5. Read a book from a new writer every month
6. Read one book per week. Or 52 books in a year
7. Take your own MBA by reading 12 business books in a year
8. Read 12 biographies of history's most influential figures 
9. Read James Altucher's book recommendations. [Full list here](https://archive.jamesaltucher.com/blog/books-saved-life/)
10. Read 10 or 12 books released more than 50 years ago. [Idea from CulturalTutor]({% post_url 2025-04-05-CulturalTutor %}).

Which one would you like to try first? For my challenge, I'm doing #4. I'm reading most of [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %})'s books.
