Earlier today, I crossed the city for some blood tests. Regular checkups. Hot and sunny outside.

I don't know if it was the heat, too much information, or just too much on my mind. (I even had to do [a brain dump]({% post_url 2026-01-15-10Thougths %}) recently.) But I had to make lemon water, put on my headphones with ocean waves, and sit to do nothing else.

Maybe that's what I needed to get over a creative block. Sometimes you need to do nothing. Not less. Nothing.

If you're reading this, try it: put down your phone or your computer, and let yourself do nothing. It might clear your block too.
