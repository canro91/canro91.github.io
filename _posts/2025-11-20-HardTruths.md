I was about to start a new list from scratch. But I remembered I already wrote about [some hard truths about coding]({% post_url 2025-04-17-HarshTruths %}).

Here are five more truths:

**#1.** Most of your day will be in meetings, not coding.

**#2.** You won't be building systems from scratch. Most of the time, you'll be [maintaining and rewriting legacy systems]({% post_url 2025-09-18-LegacyMigration %}).

**#3.** Communication skills, not more languages, will take you further. Just asking the right questions will [make you stand out]({% post_url 2025-02-26-StandOutAtWork %}).

**#4.** You will have to learn a lot of subjects. Don't try to learn them all at once. Get your feet wet in many areas, then stick to a few. The learning phase never ends.

**#5.** At some point, you'll realize [end users and business owners don't care about code]({% post_url 2025-11-17-UserDoNotCareAbotCode %}). It's a tough lesson. You won't like it, but it changes how you see coding.
