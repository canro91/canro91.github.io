Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. The day I "was let go" last year, I was told it was because of how tough the economy was doing. High interest rates? AI? But this news article shows [the real reason behind layoffs in the tech sector](https://qz.com/tech-layoffs-tax-code-trump-section-174-microsoft-meta-1851783502) (10min). Spoiler alert: nothing to do with AI.

#2. With AI, [our job is to know when to introduce outliers](https://quic.video/blog/be-the-outlier) (4min). "In a sea of fish, you want to be a narwhal."

#3. Like coding, interviewing is another skill to master. Yes, I agree the tech interview is broken and we don't know how to fix it. But if you're actively interviewing, here are [8 dos and don'ts to ace your next interviews](https://www.viblo.se/posts/interviewing/).

#4. At some point we all as coders have to make a choice: stay technical or jump the management track. The thing is [being an engineering manager has never been harder](https://www.blog4ems.com/p/being-an-engineering-manager-today-has-never-been-harder) (5min), too many hats to wear.

***

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [10 steps I'd take to build a profitable brand from scratch]({% post_url 2025-06-10-StartingFromZero %}) (4min) and [10 lessons I learned from the worst moment of my career]({% post_url 2025-06-12-WorstMoments %}) (4min). Not much about coding this week.

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... Join my course [Mastering C# Unit Testing with Real-world Examples](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-csharp-unit-testing-with-real-world-examples/?referralCode=8456B1B78E2EDE923174) on Udemy and learn unit testing best practices to write readable and maintainable unit tests in C# while refactoring real unit tests from my past projects.

See you next time,

Cesar
