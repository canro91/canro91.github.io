At times, writing (or creating anything) can feel pointless.

We don't see results or traction. That's when we should think [we're writing for our past selves]({% post_url 2025-10-08-PastSelf %}), documenting our journey, or [creating a time capsule]({% post_url 2020-07-20-TimeCapsule %}).

But these days, my scrolling led me to _[How to Make a Living as an Artist](https://essays.fnnch.com/make-a-living)_. A street artist wrote it for other artists. But the next line captures the essence of writing or any other creative pursuit:

> _If you make something that you like, at least one person will like it — you. If you make something you think other people will like, you run the risk of no one liking it at all. That would be sad._

Write what you'd read. Code the app you'd use. Paint what you'd hang in your living room. At least one person will like it. That's enough.
