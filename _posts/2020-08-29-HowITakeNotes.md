A time ago, I commented a discussion on dev.to titled [How do you make notes?](https://dev.to/kvanrooyen/how-do-you-make-notes-3444) Here it is long my reply. 

I love plain text. It's future-proof. You can use any text editor. Notepad++, SublimeText, Vim, Visual Studio Code, you name it. I use plain text for almost everything.

I write all my notes using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's formatted plain text that can be converted to HTML. Markdown is already on README files in GitHub and almost everywhere around the Internet.

To write and organize my notes I use [Notable](https://notable.app/).

For my task list, I have a [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) file. One task per line. Each task has a priority, due date and optional tags. For ideas and tasks in the future, I have a later.txt. Once a task is done, I move it to a done.txt. I keep it as a brag document. For more ideas to use plain text, you can read [Lifehacker Ten clever uses for plain text](https://lifehacker.com/ten-clever-uses-for-plain-text-files-that-can-increase-1662774267).

I have a note for every blog post, podcast, video and book I found interesting. I group these notes using the tag: "til", short for "Today I learned". I write the date, the source, the keypoints and my reaction.

I capture ideas and thoughts on my phone. "Always have something to keep notes" suggests [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning]({% post_url 2020-05-07-PragmaticThinkingAndLearning %})

Recently I found a note-taking system: [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). In short, write on your own words what you learn on a piece of paper or card, put an index number and connect it to your existing notes. Althought there are editors for Zettelkasten, I have my own slip-box and I keep my cards with pen and paper.

To read more about the Zettelkasten method, check my takeaways from the book [How to Take Smart Notes]({% post_url 2020-11-18-HowToTakeSmartNotes %}).

_Happy note taking!_
