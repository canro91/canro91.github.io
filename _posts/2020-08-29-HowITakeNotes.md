Some time ago, I commented on a discussion on dev.to titled [How do you make notes?](https://dev.to/kvanrooyen/how-do-you-make-notes-3444) Here is my long reply. 

## Plain text and Markdown

I love plain text. It's future-proof. You can use any text editor to edit text files. Notepad++, SublimeText, Vim, Visual Studio Code, you name it. I use plain text for almost everything.

I write all my notes using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's formatted plain text that renders to HTML. Markdown is already on README files in GitHub and almost everywhere on the Internet.

I write and organize my notes with [Notable](https://notable.app/). It's clean and simple.

## todo.txt and Zettelkasten

For my task list, I have a [todo.txt file](http://todotxt.org/). One task per line. Each task has a priority, due date, and optional tags.

For ideas and future tasks, I have a later.txt. Once a task is done, I move it to a done.txt file. I keep it as a brag document.

I have one note per file for every blog post, podcast, video, and book I find interesting. I group these notes using the tag: "til," short for "Today I learned." I write the date, source, key points, and my reaction.

I capture ideas and thoughts on my phone. _"Always have something to keep notes"_ suggests the [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning book]({% post_url 2020-05-07-PragmaticThinkingAndLearning %}).

Recently I found a note-taking system: [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). In short, we write our learning in our own words on a paper or card, put an index number, and connect it to our existing notes. Although there are editors for Zettelkasten, I have my own slip-box and keep my cards with pen and paper.

**Update:** These days, I've been playing with a todo.txt per day and a Bash script to start a new workday by importing the pending tasks from the previous day. Also, in the same spirit of todo.txt, I found [calendar.txt](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/calendar-txt/), a plain text calendar, and [this Bash oneliner](https://erikjohannes.no/posts/20220530-plain-text-calendar/) to open the calendar.txt file in the current date with Vim.

To read more about the Zettelkasten method, check my takeaways from the book [How to Take Smart Notes]({% post_url 2020-11-18-HowToTakeSmartNotes %}).

_Happy note-taking!_
