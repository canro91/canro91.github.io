Too much free Internet advice feels daunting.

I've gone all in on my writing skills since last year. And I've found all kinds of advice. [Write daily]({% post_url 2024-12-26-WriteDaily %}). Don't write daily...Use AI. [Don't use AI]({% post_url 2025-02-15-FightingAIContent %})...Sell more. Educate more...Find a niche. Don't find a niche...Do this. Don't do that. Arrggg!

Not all advice is suited for everyone. Not everyone is at the same stage of the journey.

The other day, someone tried to sell me a course to optimize sales funnels, when I didn't have anything to sell yet. Good advice, bad timing. The same happens with most advice we get.

Instead of taking advice from anyone and everyone at the same time, follow someone who has achieved the same results you want, listen, test, and adapt their advice.
