title: "The Real Reason Why Some Dev Companies Are Forcing AI"

I haven't stumbled upon any client or company forcing me to use AI.

That's not a reality for everybody in the industry. Today I found [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o6vjv0/completely_losing_interest_in_the_career_due_to/) from a coder who has lost interest in coding after his managers forced him to use AI and even track how many times they did it:

> _"Within the span of maybe 2 months my corporate job went from "I'll be here for life" to "Time to switch careers?" Some exec somewhere in the company decided everyone needs to be talking to AI, and they track how often you're talking with it. I ended up on a naughty list for the first time in my career, despite never having performance issues. I explain to my manager and his response is to just ask it meaningless questions."_

And past weeks, I met with some of my ex-coworkers and friends. After the usual catchup, one of them shared his company was encouraging them to use AI. Maybe productivity was the official reason. But the real reason? One of the company investors was also investing in an AI startup. And guess which AI tool they were encouraging people to use.

Just like I found the other day, [replace AI with "subscription company"]({% post_url 2025-09-10-WhatAIReallyMeans %}) and all the hype starts to make more sense.
