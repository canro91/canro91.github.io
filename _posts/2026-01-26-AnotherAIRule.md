When code breaks, you can't simply say, _"AI did that."_

You're responsible for the code you ship. That's been true from the days of copy-pasting from forums, blog posts, StackOverflow, and now from AI.

AI is fast, but over-reliance makes you lose your mental models and context—[just one problem with AI]({% post_url 2025-12-01-TooMuchAI %}).

## The new rule

To protect my skills, [I've set one rule]({% post_url 2025-10-14-AIRule %}): **Don't let AI touch your code directly.** It might feel unproductive. But it keeps my hands on the wheel.

To test this rule, I recently tried finishing a task using as much AI as possible. While going through the AI-generated code, I came up with another rule:

**If I write the code, AI reviews it. And if AI generates the code, I review it.**

That way, I use AI while keeping my code writing and reading sharp. Either way, AI is just like a copilot in the cockpit, an extra layer of safety and productivity.

AI is changing the act of coding. Some brag about coding without typing a single line of code, thanks to Claude Code. Whether what AI generates is clean code or garbage, its CEOs aren't accountable for it. We are.
