I sit somewhere in the middle of the AI hype cycle. Not a hater nor a fanatic.

I've been trying to make sense of AI by documenting my experiences and reacting to others.

Here are 4 issues I've found with using AI too much:

**#1.** [It makes us lazier than usual]({% post_url 2025-07-13-TheProblemWithAI %}). It's tempting to go straight to a chat for a quick, unreliable answer. That's the real danger.

**#2.** [It steals the joy of figuring out problems]({% post_url 2025-10-20-SloppyAI %}). No more aha moments or happy dances. Just like asking someone to chew our food to be more productive.

**#3.** [It makes you feel you're cheating]({% post_url 2025-11-11-Cheating %}). Copy-pasting without understanding has always been cheating, even in the days of forums and StackOverflow.

**#4.** [It doesn't let you build mental models to solve problems]({% post_url 2025-11-03-AIProblem %}). It's like asking someone else to go to the gym for us, then wondering why our muscles are still weak.
