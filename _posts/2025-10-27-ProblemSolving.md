Yesterday, I shared [a surprising way to improve at coding]({% post_url 2025-10-26-GettingGood %}): watching a TV show.

It wasn't Silicon Valley or Mr. Robot or any other TV show featuring hackers. It was a show about doctors. I never thought hospital drama could teach problem-solving.

## Watch _House M.D._

Let me introduce you to Gregory House, the protagonist.

He's not a regular doctor. He doesn't like patients. He doesn't wear a white coat or use a stethoscope either. He's even sick and under constant medication. Weird, right?

But he gets the most complex, rarest cases because he's a brilliant problem solver. He even runs his own department at the hospital.

Every episode is a masterclass in how to solve complex problems.

## The #1 rule of problem-solving

There's a line Dr. House says almost all the time:

**"Everybody lies."**

That's why Dr. House doesn't like to see patients. He only trusts brain scans, blood tests, and other exams.

Let me ask you this:

How many times have you received a bug report and Customer Support claimed they had verified logs, reproduced steps, and validated user data... And after [hours of debugging]({% post_url 2020-09-19-ThreeDebuggingTips %}), you realize the real problem was something they had claimed to have checked in the first place? Arrggg!

If you ask Dr. House, everybody lies:
- End users lie.
- Documentation lies.
- Customer Support lies.
- Other engineers lie.
- Even you and I lie.

Always trust but verify.

That's Dr. House's #1 rule to solve problems.

_House M.D_ has conflict and drama with [excellent storytelling]({% post_url 2025-05-18-HouseMD %}). But it also teaches powerful problem-solving lessons. I expand on what Dr. House has to teach us as coders in my book, _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding._

In my book, I suggest watching a TV show and hanging out in cafes to become a better coder. Yes! Because coding isn't just syntax and speed. It's also thinking like a doctor with complex cases.
