Hey. I just realized I already had 4 interesting links to share. I didn't want to wait until next Friday to share them. So here they are.

#1. I have to admit I fell into the specialization trap and started calling myself a "backend engineer." I stopped trying to be a full stack developer. Maybe with AI, we're witnessing [the renaissance of full stack developers](https://brodzinski.com/2025/07/renaissance-full-stack-developers.html) (10min) again.

#2. The problem with Google AI Overview is we think their answers are accurate. Hey it's Google. They must be building AI answers from all the pages they have indexed. Wrong. In fact, [Google AI Overview might kill you](https://davebarry.substack.com/p/death-by-ai) (7min)

#3. Speaking of Google killing people, Chrome killed uBlock Origin. And if you want it back, you need to turn to Firefox. Here's [a good adoption guide](https://kau.sh/blog/how-to-firefox/) (8min).

#4. From Clean Code, I learned to avoid comments, like all comments. But there's [some value in TODO comments](https://sophiebits.com/2025/07/21/todos-arent-for-doing) (2min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [productivity secrets revealed by a real spy]({% post_url 2025-07-19-ProductivitySecret %}) (2min) and [a language lessons I learned in an Asian restaurant](https://canro91.github.io/2025/07/21/Fluency/) (2min).
