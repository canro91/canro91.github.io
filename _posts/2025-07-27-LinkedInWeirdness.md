LinkedIn is a weird place.

The _"I'm pleased to announce..."_ posts, the _"I have a new certificate..."_ updates, and the B2B lessons learned from every situation. _"I just proposed, here's what it taught me about B2B sales."_

We do crazy things to impress future employers online.

Since last year, I've [posted 300+ times]({% post_url 2025-06-15-LinkedIn %}) to [grow on LinkedIn]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}). And here are a few of the weirdest things I've seen:

**#1.** A lead generation coach went full sales mode, pitching me a funnel course... when I didn't have anything to sell. _"Thanks, but... No thanks. Clicking Unfollow."_

**#2.** A DM offering to make me the "face" during interviews. I'd have to take interviews and land jobs. Then someone else would show up to work. Maybe I'd end up participating in the North Korean engineers scheme. _"Block and report. Call the Internet police?"_

**#3.** Random people liked one of my posts, then rushed to my DMs asking for a coffee chat. _"Sorry, not the best time now... or in the near future."_

**#4.** Coaches offering me "free" help, just prepping the ground for a sales pitch. _"Let's cut to the chase. What are you selling?"_

Sure, LinkedIn might be a weird place. But I've met interesting people, landed one speaking gig, and made my first Internet money. And that's why, no matter how weird it gets, I keep showing up.
