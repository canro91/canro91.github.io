Hey, I didn't miss my reading time this week. Here are 4 interesting links for you:

**#1.** One big lesson I've learned after over a decade in coding is [most technical problems are people problems](https://blog.joeschrag.com/2023/11/most-technical-problems-are-really.html) (5min). Most team problems trace back to poor communication. Just like marriages. 

**#2.** I watched Space Jam countless times as a kid. I remember it because [a coder tried to recreate its website with Claude and failed](https://j0nah.com/i-failed-to-recreate-the-1996-space-jam-website-with-claude) (10min).

**#3.** Blogging isn't dead. There are still indie bloggers in a small corner of the Internet. Here are [two ideas to discover indie bloggers](https://alexsci.com/blog/calm-tech-discover/) (3min).

**#4.** With AI spitting out code faster than any of us, [writing code may not be our main offering as coders](https://lmika.org/2025/12/14/maybe-writing-code-is-no.html) (2min), but judgment, past failed projects, and risk management.

By now, I've finished the Advent of Code. Two days were tough. Instructions weren't clear enough, or I overcomplicated my solutions. Here are two days where I got stuck: [Day 8]({% post_url 2025-12-14-AoC8 %}) (5min) and [Day 11]({% post_url 2025-12-17-AoC11 %}) (2min). I ended up looking at solutions to get unstuck.

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... my new book, _Street-Smart Coding_: 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

See you next time,

Cesar
