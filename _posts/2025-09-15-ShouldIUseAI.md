"Is using AI totally forbidden?", "When and how should I use it?", and "What's your take on vibecoding?"

I was on [a firechat with a community of new coders]({% post_url 2025-09-11-ALXSept2025 %}) last week. Those questions kept popping up. They all wanted to know about AI.

I get it! There's a lot of noise... [It's taking our jobs]({% post_url 2025-04-25-WillAITakeMyJob %}). Some guy built an app with no coding skills and now he's drinking martinis in the Caribbean. Don't be discouraged by those headlines. [This is the best time to learn coding]({% post_url 2025-08-18-TooLateToLearnCoding %}).

You won't like it, but... Here's the rule: Don't use AI to generate code until you're comfortable coding on your own.

If you only copy and paste what ChatGPT, Cursor, or "insert the newest and fastest LLM here" gives you, [you're in trouble]({% post_url 2025-07-13-TheProblemWithAI %}). You need to know if what that tool is spitting out is good code. And for that, you need your own judgment.
