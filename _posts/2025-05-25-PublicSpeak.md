Public speaking starts with a clear message.

If you need to speak publicly:
* Start with a catchy story
* Share one main idea
* Use three points to expand your main idea. Yes, three points. Our short-term memory holds around 5 or 7 items, and three is the sweet spot.
* End by inviting listeners to do something about it.

And that already sounds like a good post. A good post should have a clear message too.

Even better, if you are already writing using your own voice, print your post and read it in front of your audience, making the right pauses and changes in intonation, of course.

And, don't use a PowerPoint presentation. I learned that from [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}), from one of his interviews, I don't remember which one. A PowerPoint presentation will distract the audience from the message: you and your speech.

That works for a TED talk, a keynote speech, or a sermon.
