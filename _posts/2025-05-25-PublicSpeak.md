Public speaking requires a clear message.

If you need to public speak:
* Start with a catchy story
* Share one main idea
* Use three points to expand your main idea. Yes, three points. Our short term memory holds around 5 or 7 items. Three is the sweet spot.
* End by inviting listeners to do something about it.

And that already sounds like a good post. A good post should have a clear message too.

Even better, it you already writing using your own voice, print your post and read it in front of your audience, making the right pauses and changes in intonation, of course.

And, don’t use a PowerPoint presentation. I learned that from James Altucher, from one of his interviews, I don’t remember which one. A PowerPoint presentation will distract the audience from the message: you and your speech.

That works for a TED talk, a keynote speech, or a sermon.
