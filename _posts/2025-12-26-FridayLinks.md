Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** "AI replacing coders" and "programming being dead" have been all over the news. But that's not true. [AI can "write" code, but it can't do our job](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/12/11/ai-can-write-your-code-it-cant-do-your-job/) (5min). Coding has never been the bottleneck or the most valuable skill.

**#2.** Naming is hard. Especially when we're naming packages or tools. We've gone from descriptive to funny, unrelated names (Viper, Cobra, Melody). [We've lost the plot of naming tools](https://larr.net/p/namings.html) (9min).

**#3.** If we want to stand out among the crowd, we have to [be better than the cheap alternative](https://seths.blog/2025/12/better-than-the-cheap-alternative/) (1min): frozen pizza, smartphone camera, or AI.

**#4.** Looking for an interesting read this holiday season? Well, check out [Read Something Wonderful](https://readsomethingwonderful.com/). Just a few clicks took me to the 1,000 true fans essays, one of the most popular ones on the Internet.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [What coders could offer instead of LOCs if AI takes over]({% post_url 2025-12-21-Offerings %}) (2min) and [vibecoding ruining CS degrees]({% post_url 2025-12-22-AIRuiningDegrees %}) (3min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... my new book, _Street-Smart Coding_: 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

See you next time,

Cesar
