Today, I needed to pass a dictionary between two ASP.NET Core 6.0 API sites. To my surprise, on the receiving side, I got the dictionary with all its keys converted to lowercase instead of PascalCase. I couldn't find any element on the dictionary, even though the keys had the same names on each API site. This is what I learned about serializing dictionary keys.

## Serialization with Newtonsoft.Json

It turns out that the two API sites were using Newtonsoft.Json for serialization. Both of them used the `CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver` when adding Newtonsoft.Json.

Something like this,

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services
    .AddControllers()
    .AddNewtonsoftJson(options =>
    // ^^^^^
    {
        options.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling
            = NullValueHandling.Ignore;

        options.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver
            = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();
            //    ^^^^^
            // This is what I mean
    });

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

**With CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver, Newtonsoft.Json writes property names in camelCase. But, Newtonsoft.Json treats dictionary keys like properties too.**

That was the reason why I got my dictionary keys in lowercase. I used one-word names and Newtonsoft.Json made them camelCase.

To prove this, let's create a simple controller that read and writes a dictionary. Let's do this,

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace LowerCaseDictionaryKeys.Controllers;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class DictionaryController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public MyViewModel Post(MyViewModel input)
    {
        return input;
        //     ^^^^^
        // Just return the same input
    }
}

public class MyViewModel
{
    public IDictionary<string, string> Dict { get; set; }
}
```

Now, let's notice in the output from Postman how the request and the response differ. The keys have a different case. Arggg!

## 1. Configure Newtonsoft.Json naming strategy

**To preserve the case of dictionary keys with Newtonsoft.Json, configure the ContractResolver setting with CamelCaseNamingStrategy class and set its ProcessDictionaryKeys property to false.**

When registering Newtonsoft.Json, in the `SerializerSettings` option, let's do:

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services
    .AddControllers()
    .AddNewtonsoftJson(options =>
    // ^^^^^
    {
        options.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling
            = NullValueHandling.Ignore;

        options.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver
            = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver
            {
                NamingStrategy = new CamelCaseNamingStrategy
                {
                    ProcessDictionaryKeys = false
                    // ^^^^^
                    // Do not change dictionary keys casing
                }
            };
    });

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

For more details, see Newtonsoft.Json docs to [Configure NamingStrategy dictionary serialization](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/NamingStrategySkipDictionaryKeys.htm).

After changing the naming strategy, let's see the response of our sample controller. That's what I wanted!

### What about System.Text.Json?

To maintain case of dictionary keys with System.Text.Json, let's set the `DictionaryKeyPolicy` property inside the `JsonSerializerOptions` to `JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase`.

In our `Program.cs` class, let's write,

```csharp
using System.Text.Json;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services
    .AddControllers()
    .AddJsonOptions(options =>
    // ^^^^^
    {
        options.JsonSerializerOptions
            .DictionaryKeyPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase;
            // ^^^^^
    });

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

For more naming policies, see Microsft docs to [customize property names and values with System.Text.Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-customize-properties#camel-case-dictionary-keys).

## 2. Use a comparer with dictionaries

Another alternative is to use a dictionary with a comparer that ignores case of keys.

On the receiving API site, let's add an empty constructor on the request view model to initialize the dictionary with a comparer to ignore cases.

In my case, I was passing a metadata dictionary between the two sites. I could use a `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase` to create a dictionary ignoring the case of keys.

This way, no matter the case of keys, I could find them when using the `TryGetValue()` method.

```csharp
public class MyViewModel
{
    public MyViewModel()
    {
        Dict = new Dictionary<string, string>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        //                                    ^^^^^
    }

    public Dictionary<string, string> Dict { get; set; }
}
```

Voil√†! That's how we can configure the case of dictionary keys when serializing requests and how to read dictionaries with keys no matter the case of its keys.
