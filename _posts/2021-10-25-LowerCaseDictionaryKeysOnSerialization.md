Today, I needed to pass a dictionary between two ASP.NET Core 3.x API sites. To my surprise, on the receiving side, I got the dictionary with all its keys converted to lowercase instead of PascalCase. I couldn't find any element on the dictionary, even though the keys had the same names on each API site.

## Serialization with Newtonsoft.Json

It turns out that the two API sites were using Newtonsoft.Json for serialization. Both of them, inside the Startup class, used the name resolver `CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver` when adding Newtonsoft.Json.

Something like this,

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization;

namespace LowerCaseDictionaryKeys
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddControllers()
                    .AddNewtonsoftJson((options) =>
                    {
                        options.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling
                            = NullValueHandling.Ignore;
                        
                        // This is what I mean
                         options.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver
                            = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();
                            //    ^^^^^                            
                    });
        }

        // Rest of the file...
    }
}
```

**With CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver, Newtonsoft.Json writes property names in camelCase. But, Newtonsoft.Json treats dictionary keys like properties too.**

That was the reason why I got my dictionary keys in lowercase. I used one-word names and Newtonsoft.Json made them camelCase.

To prove this, let's create a simple controller that read and writes a dictionary. Let's do this.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace LowerCaseDictionaryKeys.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class DictionaryController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpPost]
        public MyViewModel Post(MyViewModel input)
        {
            // Just return the same input        
            return input;
        }
    }

    public class MyViewModel
    {
        public IDictionary<string, string> Dict { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Now, notice in the output from Postman how the request and the response differ. They keys have a different case. Arggg!

## 1. Configure Newtonsoft.Json NamingStrategy

**To preserve the case of dictionary keys with Newtonsoft.Json, configure the ContractResolver setting with CamelCaseNamingStrategy class and set its ProcessDictionaryKeys property to false.**

When adding Newtonsoft.Json in the Startup class, in the `SerializerSettings` option, do:

```csharp
services.AddControllers()
        .AddNewtonsoftJson((options) =>
        {
            options.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore;
            options.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver
              = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver
              {
                    NamingStrategy = new CamelCaseNamingStrategy
                    {
                        // Do not change dictionary keys casing
                        ProcessDictionaryKeys = false
                        // ^^^^^
                    }
              };
        });
```

For more details, see Newtonsoft.Json docs to [Configure NamingStrategy dictionary serialization](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/NamingStrategySkipDictionaryKeys.htm).

After changing the naming strategy, let's see the response of our sample controller. That's what I wanted!

### System.Text.Json Key Policy

What about System.Text.Json? To maintain case of dictionary keys with System.Text.Json, set the `DictionaryKeyPolicy` property inside the `JsonSerializerOptions` to `JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase`.

In your `ConfigureServices()` method, do.

```csharp
services.AddControllers()
        .AddJsonOptions(options =>
        {
            options.JsonSerializerOptions.DictionaryKeyPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase;
            //                            ^^^^^
        });
```

For more naming policies, see Microsft docs to [customize property names and values with System.Text.Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-customize-properties#camel-case-dictionary-keys).

## 2. Use a comparer in your dictionary

Another alternative is to use a dictionary with a comparer that ignores case of keys.

On the receiving API site, you can add an empty constructor on the request view model to initialize the dictionary with a comparer to ignore cases.

In my case, I was passing a metadata dictionary between the two sites. I could use a `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase` to create a dictionary ignoring the case of keys.

This way, no matter the case of keys, I could find them when using the `TryGetValue()` method.

```csharp
public class MyViewModel
{
    public MyViewModel()
    {
        Dict = new Dictionary<string, string>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        //                                    ^^^^^
    }

    public Dictionary<string, string> Dict { get; set; }
}
```

Voil√†! That's how we can configure the case of dictionary keys when serializing requests and how to read dictionaries with keys no matter the case of its keys.
