Do you have a minute?

That was the last message you got from your boss' boss.

Earlier that day, you logged in to work as usual. And you had a couple of "Are you still around?" messages. You knew it was happening. Again.

Then came a quick goodbye message from another colleague. He shared his email and contact details.

You went through the daily meeting knowing something was in the air. Some team members didn't show up. Everybody pretended nothing was happening. But everyone knew it. It was the most awkward and useless daily meeting of all.

This "Do you have a minute?" conversation was different. You felt the disturbance in the Force right from the start. Your boss' boss looked downwards, his voice is trembling. A small speech of how bad the economy was going. Your only thought was, "It's my turn?"

Then the bomb: "We have to let you go this time."

Definitely, it was your turn.

You left that last meeting relieved and worried at the same time. "What am I going to do now?"

And just like that, you got disconnected from the VPN and the company chat.

It was nice while it lasted.

That's how being laid off feels. I know. I've been there. More than once.

Layoffs are always around the corner. High interest rates. A recession. AI...Today it's a large U.S. company. Tomorrow who knows?

We're better off rolling our own insurance policy:
* Building a brand
* Starting a side hustle
* Creating an emergency fund
* Growing a professional network
* Having multiple sources of income
* Learning different skills to monetize

Winter is always coming. Make yourself layoff-proof.
