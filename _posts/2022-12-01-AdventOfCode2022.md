This year, inspired by [C# Advent](https://csadvent.christmas/about) and [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/), I decided to do my own Christmas challenge: my own Advent of Code. I prefer to call it: Advent of Posts. Starting on December 1st, I'm publishing 24 posts, one post per day.

The challenge is to write an article per day in about 2 hours, including proof-reading and banner design. I've written some of the post in advance to avoid content pressure.

Here is my Advent of Posts:

* Day 1: [How to write tests for HttpClient using Moq]({% post_url 2022-12-01-TestingHttpClient %})
* Day 2: [TIL: Always check for missing configuration values inside constructors]({% post_url 2022-12-02-ValidateInputParameters %})
