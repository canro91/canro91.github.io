Some days ago I found out this [Hacker News question](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35164819) about what blogging has done for blog writers. I realized that I published my first blog post five years ago. I'd like to share what blogging has done for me.

In a past post, I shared [how I started blogging]({% post_url 2020-07-18-HowIStartedBlogging %}) and the story behind my first post. Long story short: I didn't want to throw away some hours of Googling.

## 1. What has my blog done for me?

I wish I could tell that I could live out of my blog. That's not the case yet. But it had opened doors here and there.

After sharing some of my posts on [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/iamcesaraguirre), I got an invitation to create text-based programming courses on a new teaching platform. I wrote a couple of C# courses there.

Again from LinkedIn, someone from the Marketing team of a software company reached out to me for a content collaboration. I wrote two sponsor posts here on my blog and others on its company blog.

On another occasion, an acquaintance set me up for an interview for a full-time opportunity as a software engineer. I declined it, but that interview ended up being another content collaboration. I helped that company to start a Medium publication.

## 2. Skills blogging has taught me

Apart from content collaborations, keeping a blog made learn two skills: online writing and SEO.

I haven't updated [my first post]({% post_url 2018-07-18-AOPWithFody %}). It's right there to remind me how I started. At the time, I had zero experience writing online. I only threw some words into an empty file and put it online.

I had to learn to use shorter sentences, descriptive subheadings, and clear structure.

I learned to target my posts to a user search query. Also I learned to distinguish between posts I want to rank and posts where I share some thoughts. This is one of them.

I stopped writing about whatever came to my mind to follow a topic over a series of posts regularly. 

## 3. Sources of inspiration

In all these years, I have received inspiration from others in the process.

In 2020, I found the [Guest Writer Program from exceptionnotfound.net](https://exceptionnotfound.net/guest-writer-program/) and accepted the challenge. I wrote [three guest posts](https://exceptionnotfound.net/author/cesar-aguirre/) there. That experience helped me to better structure and format a blog post. Thanks, Matthew, if you ever read this.

The book [Show Your Work by Austin Kleon]({% post_url 2020-10-01-ShowYourWorkTakeaways %}) inspired me to keep writing. Not only do the end results matter, the process to get there, too. I learned that from the book.

I follow the mantra: "If something takes you more than 20 minutes to figure out, it should be a post." I learned that from a YouTube video, I can't find any more.

## 4. Some of my favorite and popular posts

In these five years, Iâ€™ve written 152 posts, to be precise. Some blog posts came from my frustrations, curiosity, and learning. Often, I like to think of my blog as [my own time capsule]({% post_url 2020-07-20-TimeCapsule %}) and [a tool to preserve my keystrokes]({% post_url 2021-12-06-ItsNotWhatYouRead %}). 

These are some of my favorite posts:

- [C# Definitive Guide]({% post_url 2018-11-17-TheC#DefinitiveGuide %}): This is my roadmap for C# intermediate developers.
- [Parsinator: A tale of a PDF parser]({% post_url 2019-03-08-ATaleOfAPdfParser %}): This is about Parsinator, a small project I wrote in record time to keep one of my previous employers onboarding new clients.
- [A quick guide to LINQ with examples]({% post_url 2021-01-18-LinqGuide %}): I wrote this one to help a friend. She was preparing for a technical interview. This is an "all you need to know" post. I ended up expanding it into a full series of posts and a text-based course.
- [Unit Testing 101]({% post_url 2021-03-15-UnitTesting101 %}): This is one of the guest posts I originally wrote on exceptionnotfound.net. I expanded it to a whole series of posts about unit testing. 

These are some of the most popular ones:

- [Two free tools to format SQL queries]({% post_url 2020-09-30-FormatSQL %}): I got tired of formatting queries manually, so...
- [How to compare DateTime without the time part in SQL Server]({% post_url 2020-10-05-CompareDateTimeSQLServer %})
- [Four naming conventions for unit tests]({% post_url 2021-04-12-UnitTestNamingConventions %})
- [How to add a caching layer with ASP.NET Core]({% post_url 2020-06-29-HowToAddACacheLayer %})

Voila! That's my blogging journey over these five years. I hope you stick around for the "Ten years ago, I published my first post" reflection.

If you ask me where my blog will take me, I'd say: "dunno, let's find out."

Thanks to all the heroes who contacted me to point out typos or a wrong variable name in my posts.
