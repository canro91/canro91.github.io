Hey! Here are 3 reads (plus a funny bonus) I found interesting this week.

**#1.** After being afraid of sharing them, here are [the confessions of an uncensored coder](https://kerrick.blog/articles/2025/confessions-of-a-software-developer-no-more-self-censorship/) (10min). I agree, we don't have to learn everything about everything. And I have to confess I don’t fully understand Blazor, in spite of working with it for almost a year.

**#2.** Most companies only offer two tracks for coders. You either stay as an Individual Contributor or join the Management side. Switching between the two is called: "manager pendulum." But [AI might be breaking the pendulum](https://www.modernleader.is/p/pendulum-revisited) (10min), creating hybrid roles. Or maybe it's just an excuse to get rid of the role and the compensation?

**#3.** It's easier than ever to start coding. But it's getting harder and harder to break into the market as a junior coder. [We're in a junior hiring crisis](https://people-work.io/blog/junior-hiring-crisis/) (10min). AI seems to have a lot with it...And just in the past few weeks, someone in the same situation reached out on LinkedIn asking for advice. I didn't have much to say.

**Bonus:** What if we let AI replace our bosses? Here's [replaceyourboss.ai](https://replaceyourboss.ai/). The funniest line I got: "Let's cut the single-use cups but keep the private jet for strategic mobility."

On my blog, this past week, I shared about [4 AI issues I've collected]({% post_url 2025-12-01-TooMuchAI %}) (2min) and [4 lessons I learned while fighting next to my mom with a chronic disease]({% post_url 2025-11-29-Fighting %}) (3min). Feel free to skip that last one if you only want to read about coding. I won't get mad.

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... My latest book, [Street-Smart Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=friday-links-singleletter-names-windows-optimization): 30 lessons to help you code like a pro, from Googling to clear communication. It's the roadmap I wish I had moving from junior to senior and the one I hope helps you too.

See you next time,

Cesar
