Another Monday Links. Five articles I found interesting in last month.

## Don't waste time on heroic death marches

"Successful companies, whether they're programming houses, retailers, law firms, whatever, make their employees' needs a priority." Totally agree. No more comments! [Read full article](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3630653/dont-waste-time-on-heroic-death-marches.html)

## How to study effectively

One of my favorite subjects: how to study. Don't cram. Don't reread the material. Don't highlight. Instead, study in short sessions and recall the material. Easy! There are even more strategies.

## Undervalued Software Engineering Skills: Writing Well

## 15 signs you joined the wrong company as a developer
