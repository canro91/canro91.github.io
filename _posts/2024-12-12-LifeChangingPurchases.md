I'm answering this [Hacker News question](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42079768):

> Is there anything you've bought in the past few years (since 2020) that really changed something in your life?

They didn't change my life, but they've made it somewhat better:

1. A pair of 5-kg dumbbells: Cheaper than a yearly gym subscription. With a couple of YouTube videos, they're enough to keep moving my body every day.

2. Money and personal development books: I bought print copies of these titles:
	* The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari
	* The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry
	* The Richest Man in Babylon
	* The Psychology of Money
	* Think and Grow Rich
	* Unwinding Anxiety
	* Purify Your Brain

3. Workstation setup: Since I spend most of my working time in front of a computer, I bought an air conditioner, a standing desk, and an external display.

4. Writing course: I've been writing since 2018 when I wrote [my first blog post]({% post_url 2023-07-18-FiveYearsOfBlogging %}). But most of what I had learned was through trial and error. This year, I paid for a writing course and went all in with my writing.

5. Eating out with friends: Some friends are worth every cup of coffee or dinner out.
