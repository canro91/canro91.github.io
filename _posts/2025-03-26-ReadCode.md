We spend more time reading than writing code, but we're seldom taught how to read it.

Almost 100% of my coding courses in university were about writing code: syntax, algorithms, and class design. Nothing about reading. I only learned about reading code from [a coworker at a past job]({% post_url 2022-12-18-LessonsFromExCoworkers %}).

Yesterday, I found this conversation as part of the GOTO Conference about reading code:

</div>

Here are some key points from that conversation:

**#1. Read a piece of code at first glance and see what stands out.** Maybe that's a function or a symbol or a messy block of code. That's also my go-to guide to refactor a piece of code: _while scrolling through a piece of code, if I need to stop and read it twice, there's something to refactor, something needs to be better explained._

**#2. Read with empathy.** After reading [Clean Code]({% post_url 2020-01-06-CleanCodeReview %}) for the first time, when I found a piece of code that wasn't closely aligned to the book, I always said "who wrote this crap?!" I had to learn that we all do our best with the context and deadlines we have. If we have to fix a pressing issue in 24 hours, we do our best. That might not be the perfect solution. And of course, there will always be better ways to solve a problem, once we solve it for the first time.

**#3. Always start by pointing the good parts,** especially when auditing or reviewing other people's code. It reminds me of the principle from How to Win Friends and Influence People: don't tell anyone they're wrong.

Read more code, that's [the best way to learn to code]({% post_url 2024-12-31-GetBetterAtCoding %}). The more code you read, the better at writing you become.
