One of my posts recently went viral on dev.to.

It was the one about [why we shouldn't try to test private methods]({% post_url 2024-11-30-TestingPrivateMethods %}). And here's the [dev.to version](https://dev.to/canro91/this-is-why-we-dont-test-private-methods-28ef).

When I say "viral," I mean viral by my standards. It received +30 reactions, +30 comments, and +5K views. That was after two days of posting. Two days. It probably got syndicated or reshared somewhere else.

It's not that impressive for tech influencers with a larger follower count. But it is for me.

Since I don't want this to be a "see how cool I am" kind of post, here are 5 lessons I learned that I'd like to pass on to new bloggers:

## 1. You can't predict your next hit

No matter how hard you try, you can't predict which post will go "viral."

Often the posts you write to mark the calendar are the ones that get some traction, not the ones you spend time crafting. This one was one of those. I wrote it to mark the calendar as part of my 100-daily-posts challenge I started in November 2024.

Since you can't predict your hits, keep writing, even if you think nobody is reading.

## 2. Go with social blogs to get more traction

I wrote that post originally here on my blog in November 2024. Since then, it only got less than 10 views.

But it went viral when I reposted it on dev.to. It was sitting on my blog behind search engines. I had to wait for search engine bots to crawl, index, and rank my post. And that could take weeks or months.

On social blogs, like dev.to or Medium, there's already an audience and a discoverability feature. Old-fashioned blogs don't have that. That's the problem with blogs.

If you're new to blogging or [struggling to keep writing]({% post_url 2024-09-23-StrugglingToWrite %}), don't start on your own blog. Go with a social blog. If you don't know where to start, try with dev.to.

## 3. Always promote something at the end of your posts

These days, I have learned from [Spain's top copywriter]({% post_url 2025-01-16-SpainTopCopywriter %}), that an email should be like a radio show.

A radio show has a bit of education, a bit of entertainment, and a promotion. And a post should be the same.

Promote something at the end of your posts: your ebooks, newsletter, or courses. I got 7 downloads of my ebook [Unit Testing 101: From Zero to Your First Tests](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/unittesting101) on my Gumroad page thanks to that post.

Promote something that aligns with the content of your posts. Share something of value, not just simply asking for a coffee.

If you don't have an ebook or something, promote other posts. If Netflix does the same at the end of a movie or show, we can do the same.

## 4. Remember the 30/30/30 rule

My post got more than 30 comments.

Some people jumped to support my idea. Others jumped to offer interesting alternatives. Others simply said I wasn't answering anything. Others went on a tangent talking about 3D rendering with JavaScript. Somebody else jumped to promote a jewelry business or something. Whaaaat! Yes, a jewelry business on a coding platform. Whatever.

No matter who you are or what you do, 30% will love it, 30% will hate it, and 30% won't even care.

## 5. Answer questions in public

I didn't come up with the subject of that post myself. I stole it.

One day I was wasting my time on Reddit, probably waiting on a line or something, and I found that question. I realized I could answer it and I did so.

It was a genuine question someone asked. Someone else will probably google the same question. And answering it was good in SEO terms for my blog. And that's one of the tricks you can use to [double your post count]({% post_url 2025-01-28-DoubleYourPostCount %}).
