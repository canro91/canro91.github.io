title: "Want To Write As A Coder? Start With TIL Posts"

If you want to start a coding blog, don't start with a deep dive of the Linux Kernel or other cryptic topics.

Instead write short "Today I Learned" (TIL) posts.

TIL posts are shorter posts where you share something you've found or figured out. You don't have to worry about long introductions or conclusions. Just write a good headline, a code block, a quick explanation, and your sources. [Write using your own words]({% post_url 2024-12-24-WritingVoice %}), like in a conversation with a coworker. That's enough to [make a post worth reading]({% post_url 2025-03-11-BloggingTips %}).

Here are [my TIL posts](/tags/todayilearned/) as example.

TIL posts invite people into your learning journey.

Don't try to lecture the coding world about what they should do. Start documenting your learning instead.

Instead of writing _"5 VS Code extensions every coder should install,"_ try _"TIL: 5 VS Code extensions I couldn't avoid installing."_ Or instead of _"5 Git commands every coder should know,"_ covering the same basic Git commands, write _"TIL: 5 Git basic commands to use everyday"_ or _"TIL: How Git Status works."_

Spent [20 minutes or more figuring out something]({% post_url 2024-09-09-WritingIdeas %})? write a TIL post. That's the easiest way to start a coding blog.
