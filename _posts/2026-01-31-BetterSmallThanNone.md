title: "Better A Small Rep Than A Broken Habit"

_Yesterday I found a LinkedIn post asking if a crap post was better than no post at all. I didn't want to bury my answer on the comments section. So I'm expanding it a bit here._

A crap post is better than silence.

Well, [90% of everything is crap]({% post_url 2025-01-02-SturgeonLaw %}). Most of what we create won't be great. And that's ok.

But writing, coding, or any creative pursuit is like exercising. Skip the gym once, nothing happens. Skip twice, and suddenly you're on the couch, binge-watching Netflix, wondering where the extra weight came from.

Whether it's [a post slightly longer than a Tweet]({% post_url 2024-11-13-BlogMore %}), some [random]({% post_url 2026-01-15-10Thougths %}) [thoughts]({% post_url 2026-01-29-RandomThoughts %}), a few lines of code, or quick sketches, [a small, imperfect repetition]({% post_url 2024-12-14-Consistency %}) is better than breaking a habit.

Your small reps won't make you lose credibility. They prove that when life throws curveballs, your habit stays intact.
