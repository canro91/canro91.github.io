Last month, I launched [Street-Smart Coding]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}), my first "official" book. It felt exciting and terrifying.

I had already written books, but I didn't call them that. I thought only traditionally published works counted. And I didn't know about [writing mini-books]({% post_url 2025-10-07-MiniBooks %}). I had to change my mind about [the concept of a book]({% post_url 2025-04-22-BookForGrandkids %}).

Here are 4 realizations I've had after launching it:

**#1. The real work starts when you write the last words of your first draft.** Editing, designing, launching, and promoting, that's 80% of the work after the draft.

**#2. Once your book is out, the game is in your mind.** Waking up to see sales notifications is so satisfying. But silence is draining. I kept refreshing the sales dashboard, asking: "Why isn't it selling? Is it me, the sales page, or the price?" The inner voice speaks louder than your wins.

The other day, Ryan Holiday, a New York Times best-selling author, shared that as soon as he finishes a book, he focuses on what he can control: working on the next. Now I see why.

**#3. It's easy to fall into the comparison trap online.** These days, Gregory Orosz, the guy behind The Pragmatic Engineer, shared an update on his book _The Software Engineer's Guidebook_ after one year of launch. He shared sales figures. My first thought: I'm far from those numbers. But he admitted that his book is an outlier. Comparison is the thief of joy.

**#4. If someone outside your circle buys your book, it's already a win.** That's a line I found the other day scrolling on r/writing. It's an anchor to put our feet back on the ground. By that definition, my book is already a success. And I already passed [the $1 test]({% post_url 2025-10-12-1DollarTest %}).
