Software projects don't fail because of the tech stack, programming languages, or frameworks.

Sure, choosing the right tech stack is critical for the success of a software project. But software projects fail due to unclear expectations and communication issues. Even unclear expectations are a communication issue too.

This is a failed software project that was killed by unclear expectations and poor communication.

This was a one-month project to integrate a Property Management System (PMS) with a third-party Guest Messaging System. The idea was to sync reservations and guest data to this third-party system, so hotels could send their guests reminders and Welcome messages.

Even though our team delivered the project, we made some mistakes and I learned a lesson or two.

## 1. Minimize Moving Parts

Before starting the project, we worked with an N-tier architecture. Controllers call Services that use Repositories to talk to a database. There's nothing wrong with that.

But, the new guideline was to "[start doing DDD]({% post_url 2022-10-03-HandsOnDDDTakeaways %})." That's not a bad thing per se. The thing was: almost nobody in the team was familiar with DDD.

I had worked with some of the DDD artifacts before. But, we didn't know what the upper management wanted with "start doing DDD." 

With this decision, a one-month project ended up being behind schedule.

After reading posts and sneaking into GitHub template projects, two or three weeks later, we agreed on the project structure, aggregate and entity names, and an overall approach. We were already late.

For such a small project with a tight schedule, there was no room for experimentation.

_"The best tool for a job is the tool you already know."_ At that time, the best tool for my team was N-tier architecture.

For my future projects, I will minimize the moving parts.

## 2. Define a Clear Path

We agreed on reading the "guests" and "reservations" tables inside a [background processor]({% post_url 2022-12-06-BackgroundServicesAndLiteHangfire %}) to call the third-party APIs. And we stared working on it.

But another team member was analyzing how to implement an Event-Driven solution with a message queue.

Our team member didn't realize that his solution required "touching" some parts of the Reservation lifecycle, with all the Development and Testing effort implied.

Although his idea could be the right solution, in theory, we already chose the low-risk solution. He wasted some time we could have used on something else. 

For my future projects, I will define a clear path and have everybody on-boarded.

## 3. Don't Get Distracted. Cross the Finish Line

With a defined solution and everybody working on it, the team lead decided to put the project back on track with more meetings and ceremonies.

We started to estimate with poker planning.

During some of the planning sessions, we joked about putting "in one month" as the completion date for all tickets and stopped doing those meetings.

Why should everyone in the team vote for an estimation on a task somebody else was already working on? We all knew what we needed and what everybody else was doing.

It was time to focus on the goal and not get distracted by unproductive ceremonies or meetings. I don't mean stop [writing unit tests]({% post_url 2021-03-15-UnitTesting101 %}) or [doing code reviews]({% post_url 2019-12-17-BetterCodeReviews %}). Those were the minimum safety procedures for the team.

For my future projects, I will focus on crossing the finish line.

Voil√†! These are the postmortem lessons I learned from this project. Although tech choice plays a role in the success of a project, I found that "people and interactions" are way more important than choosing the right libraries and frameworks.

I bet we can find fail projects using the most state-of-the-art technology or programming languages.

Like marriages, software projects fail because of unclear expectations and poor communication. This was one of them.
