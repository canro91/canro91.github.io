These days a loved one needed a blood transfusion.

My first instinct to look for donors was to write a WhatsApp status for my friends and contacts to see. I wrote something like,

> "Urgent! Blood donors needed. O+. DM for more info."

But then I realized I made the #1 mistake of writing and copywriting. I made the message about me, not about the readers. Anyone reading would ask, "What's in there for me?" There was nothing for the reader.

After realizing my mistake, I wore my copywriting hat and changed my message,

> "Has you done your good action of the day? Donate blood. It only takes a few minutes, you get a souvenir and have the chance of saving a life. DM me and I'd tell you how to help."

That's a copy written in favor of the reader, not of the writer. Because good copy and good writing is always about the reader.
