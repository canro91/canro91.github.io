Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** When coding was the bottleneck, we used 2-pizza teams. Now, with AI writing decent code, we have to rethink team organization. AI is turning teams into [1-pizza teams](https://www.jampa.dev/p/the-rise-of-one-pizza-engineering) (7min) while creating new roles.

**#2.** Most of us coders are problem solvers at heart. The worst part is that makes us [addicted to being useful](https://www.seangoedecke.com/addicted-to-being-useful/) (6min).

**#3.** We are at [a turning point of our career as coders](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2026/02/07/you-are-here.html) (5min). Software's first "season" is over. But the next one will be _"more interesting, more economically valuable, and more mentally stimulating than we can imagine right now."_

**#4.** Anthropic found that over-relying on AI leads to a "statistically significant decrease in mastery." [A truth everybody already knows](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/study-finds-obvious-truth/) (2min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the stats that deflate the AI hype]({% post_url 2026-02-06-AIStats %}) (2min) (more revealing that Anthropic's study) and [how I'm embracing boredom]({% post_url 2026-02-03-Boredom %}) (3min) (My phone screen time was quite shocking).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... _Street-Smart Coding,_ 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

Until next Friday. Keep coding smartly
