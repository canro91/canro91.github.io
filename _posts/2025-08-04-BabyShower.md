When you're a teenager, you get invitations to "sweet 16" or quinceañera parties.

When you're in your 20s, you get wedding invitations. In your 30s, baby shower invitations.

This week, my best friend invited me to her first baby shower.

That made me think of other types of "shower" celebrations we as adults could host:

**#1. A business shower:** Guests support your new business by buying your product, leaving a 5-star review, and maybe even donating to cover some business expenses. Maybe a little something to cover your accountant's fee. Taxes don't file themselves.

**#2. A breakup shower:** Guests show up with breakup survival kits: ice cream, wine, a sad playlist, and romantic movies. Or whatever people eat and drink to get over a breakup. Maybe a guest can introduce you to someone or arrange a blind date for you.

**#3. A new apartment shower:** If you leave your parents' nest or just get married, you can host a new apartment shower. Guests bring utensils and cleaning supplies to fill your empty new apartment.

**#4. A divorce shower:** This shower is for turning "that page." Your guests help you throw away stuff from your past life or simply buy anything that reminds you of your ex.

**#5. A college shower:** About to start college? Invite your family and friends to help you with... Wondering what college students need these days? Probably notebooks, a laptop and a ChatGPT subscription. And maybe ask for some extra money to pay for the college tuition.

**#6. A first job shower:** [Got your first job]({% post_url 2024-09-02-LessonsFromMyFirstCodingJob %})? Congrats! Host a first job shower. Guests give you a jacket and tie, help you with a professional headshot to update your LinkedIn account, and buy you a Netflix subscription so you can unplug after a busy day.

**#7. A layoff shower:** [Got laid off]({% post_url 2024-12-05-HowALayoffFeels %})? Sorry to hear that. You're not alone. Host a layoff shower: guests help [revamp your CV]({% post_url 2024-10-07-TipsToWriteBetterCVs %}), write LinkedIn recommendations, or maybe offer a referral. Now that I think about it, this would be like a breakup shower. These days I think pretty much everybody in tech would run this one. Wait if I got laid off more than one year ago, can I still host one? Asking for my LinkedIn account.
