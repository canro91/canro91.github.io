_Following my own advice, I'm writing a 10-idea list to [quiet the chatter in my head]({% post_url 2025-04-19-CalmDown %}). Not that I had writer's block, but a "too much noise in my head" block—If that's even a thing._

**#1. Use your blog as insurance.** [Blogs might feel dead]({% post_url 2025-05-02-Blogging %}). People consume content inside platforms, instead of Googling to land on personal blogs. But your blog is your insurance against dead platforms and suspensions. If you trigger a filter inside a platform, even if it's a false positive, your account gets suspended, with almost no chance of getting it back.

**#2. Your real asset is your email list.** I've heard it plenty of times: _"Build your list...,"_ _"Count subscribers, not followers..."_ But it wasn't until my account on a social blog got suspended that I learned the lesson.

**#3. Cut the news.** Venezuela, Iran, Israel, United States...There's always something going on somewhere. Unless you're a diplomat, advisor, or spy, there's almost nothing you can do. News only makes you anxious.

**#4. _"I want to build a product."_** This is the second or third time I've heard a friend saying they want to build something beyond the 9-5. The problem? They recreate their day job after hours, when there's less energy and willpower. A better alternative is to make experiments and [create something in two hours]({% post_url 2025-12-30-TwoHours %}). Or [a portfolio of small bets]({% post_url 2025-07-06-SmallBets %}).

**#5. We live without being conscious of our bodies.** I'm rereading _The Power of Now_ by Eckhart Tolle. I wasn't ready the first time I read it. One takeaway so far: We're so in our heads we forget our bodies. Just stop to breathe.

**#6. Coding is changing for good.** I keep seeing people on the IndieWeb and LinkedIn brag about coding without touching an editor or IDE. Now they "code" from their phones with Claude Code. Maybe [writing lines of code is becoming optional]({% post_url 2026-01-04-CodeCantSpeak %}).

**#7. Write books for AI to read.** The other day, Kevin Kelly said he writes (or plans to write) his books for AI. What if we offer our books as chatbots? Instead of reading it, people talk with them. It's another reminder that our job as writers is to adapt to how our readers consume content. Credits to [Smart Brevity]({% post_url 2026-01-07-SmartBrevity %}). That's how we're consuming content now.

**#8. 12 apps in a year.** The other day, I found an indie blogger running a challenge: building one small app per month. Such a great idea! Forget the next Uber, build tiny apps (or websites) that solve a simple problem and put a "Buy me a Coffee" link. Something like a "pill time calculator" or "time off finder." Those are two small apps I'd use.

**#9. Do something hard this year.** This idea comes from Ryan Holiday. Marcus Aurelius, or another stoic, used to jump into a frozen lake at the start of every year. Prove yourself wrong and do something hard. Maybe that's a side project, a book, or a jump into a frozen lake.

**#10. You're not too late.** I just listened to an interview with Hassan Osman, a book writer, course creator, and podcaster. He admitted part of the success of his books and courses was starting around the lockdown in 2020. The best time was five years ago. The next best time to take action is now. Experiment, and double down.
