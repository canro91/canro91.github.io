Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. We as coders take pride in our craft. We like to follow principles and best practices: KISS, SOLID, DRY. But there are [some coding myths we need to retire](https://amritpandey.io/programming-myths-we-desperately-need-to-retire/) (8min).

#2. There's one problem with the "get things done" attitude of startups: security. Here's [a breakdown of security issues found on a dating app](https://alexschapiro.com/blog/security/vulnerability/2025/04/21/startups-need-to-take-security-seriously) (8min). They had broken one-time passwords and open endpoints. Security shouldn't be an afterthought.

#3. A URL shortener is maybe the new "hello, world" for distributed apps. But building one doesn't have to be that complicated. Here's [a simple not-overengineered alternative](https://www.luu.io/posts/2025-over-engineer-url-shortener) (6min).

#4. Dragging and dropping controls onto a canvas is normal these days. Even the word "controls" is normal. But someone has to come up with all those ideas. They started with the release of Visual Basic, back in the 80s. Here's [the history and legacy of Visual Basic](https://retool.com/visual-basic) (20min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [cURL, a simpler and faster alternative to Postman]({% post_url 2025-05-14-AlternativeToPostman %}) (2min) and [how to find all 3-digit numbers in a tree]({% post_url 2025-05-11-DigitsOnATree %}) (4min).
