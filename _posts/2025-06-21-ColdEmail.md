title: "Ignore These 15 Ideas and Get Ghosted When Cold Emailing Clients or Busy People"

In 2019, I started my first attempt at running a freelancing business.

I had started freelancing for a company I had just left. I thought I could do the same for other companies. My strategy for finding clients? Cold emailing any software agency I could find.

I even emailed every recruiter I found on open applications on LinkedIn. Those days, LinkedIn was flooded with "life-changing opportunities." Sorry, I meant job listings.

I don't remember how many emails I sent. But I remember getting just one reply. When I followed up, I only heard crickets.

## Here are 15 ideas to reduce chances of getting ghosted when cold emailing clients or anyone else:

**#1. Send 10 ideas for free.** Don't expect anything in return. This is James Altucher's idea to [become an idea machine]({% post_url 2024-11-05-IdeaMachine %}).

**#2. Don't give your reader homework.** _"Fill out this application form to apply."_

**#3. Make an offer simple to say yes.** _"For $x, I do XYZ."_

**#4. Don't make your reader look or feel bad.** _"Your YouTube video thumbnails suck, but I'm here to rescue you."_ Good luck with that!

**#5. Show real interest.** _"Hey, I've been following your content and liked your take on XYZ"_ or something like that.

**#6. Start with a genuine compliment.** Probably an idea I picked from "How to Win Friends and Influence People."

**#7. Sound like a real human being.** Write using your own words.

**#8. Don't copy pitches from the Internet.**

**#9. Don't use classical sales tactics.** _"Hurry up! Only X seats left. Limited offer."_ Think you're reaching out to [help, not to close]({% post_url 2024-11-01-SellingVsHelping %}).

**#10. Don't just ask for something in exchange for nothing.** _"Let's do a collaboration. You do something for me, but I don't do anything for you."_ Yeah, I've received DMs on LinkedIn in those lines.

**#11. Interact with your reader's content first on social media.**

**#12. Use a catchy subject line in your email.**

**#13. Spell your reader's name or title correctly.** You don't know how many emails and DMs I've ignored simply because they started with "Hello, coach Cesar." I don't have a coaching business and I don't have "coach" next to my name anywhere online. Somebody just use a template, got you!

**#14. Tell them how you found their contact details.** _"I found your email on your LinkedIn profile..."_

**#15. Include your own socials or portfolio as proof you're real.** Nothing fancy, you could try adding them under your signature.

Last year, I found a job listing I liked. They were looking for people on-site in a different country, but it didn't stop me. I reached out to the CEO sharing 10 ideas to improve their product landing page. My mistake? I misspelled the company name. Maybe that's why I never got a reply.
