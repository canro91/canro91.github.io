title: "The Clean Coder: Three Takeaways"
tags: books
---

The Clean Coder is the second book on the Clean Code trilogy. It should be a mandatory reading for any professional programmer. These are my main takeaways.

**The Clean Coder isn't about programming in itself. It's about the professional practice of programming. It covers from what is professionalism to testing strategies, pressure and time management.**

## Professionalism

> _Your career is your responsibility, not your employer's_

Professionalism is all about taking responsibility.

* **Do not harm**: Do not release code, you aren't certain about. If QA or an user finds a bug, you should be surprised. Make sure to take steps to prevent it to happen in the future.
* **Know how it works**: Every line of code should be tested. Professional developers test their code.
* **Know your domain**: It's unprofessional to code your spec without any knowledge of the domain.
* **Practice**: It’s what you do when you aren’t getting paid so you will be paid well.
* **Be calm and decisive under pressure**: Enjoy your career, don’t do it under pressure. Avoid situations that cause stress. For example, commit to deadlines.
* **Meetings are necessary and costly**. It’s unprofessional to attend to so many meetings.
When the meetings get boring, be polite and ask if your presence is still needed.

## Say No/Say Yes

> _Say. Mean. Do_

Professionals have courage to say no to their managers. Also, as professional, you don’t have to say yes to everything. But you should find a creative way to make a yes possible.

* **There is no “trying”**. Say no and offer a trade-off. _“Try”_ is taken as yes and outcomes are expected accordingly
* **You can’t commit to things you don’t control**. But, you can commit to some actions. For example, if you need somebody else to finish a dependency, create an interface and meet with the responsible guy.
* **Raise the flag**. If you don’t tell someone you have a problem as soon as possible, you won’t have someone to help you on time.
* Saying yes to drop out professionalism is not the way to solve problems.

## Coding

> _It could be consider unprofessional not to use TDD_

* **If you are tired or distracted, do not code**. Coding requires concentration. And you will end up rewriting your work.
* **Be polite!** Remember you will be the next one interrupting someone else. Use a failing test to let you know where you were after an interruption.
* **Debugging time is as expensive as coding time.** Reduce your debugging time to almost 0. Use TDD, instead. 
* **When you are late, raise the flag and be honest.** It isn’t ok to say up to the end you’re fine and not to deliver your task.
* **Be honest about finishing your work.** The worst attitude is when you say you’re done when you actually aren’t.
* **Ask for help.** It’s unprofessional to remain stuck when there is help available.

Voilà! These are my main points from The Clean Coder. Do you see why I think it should be a mandatory reading? Oh, I missed another thing. An estimate isn't a date, but a range of dates.
