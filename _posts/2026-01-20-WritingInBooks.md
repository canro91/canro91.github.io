title: "Why You Should Write and Underline in Books"

Recently, I found a book my mom left behind. It felt like opening a time capsule.

It's _Secrets to Thrive in Life_ (or _Secretos para triunfar en la vida_ in Spanish). She always mentioned that book.

It's a collection of maxims, proverbs, and passages from other personal development books. On the first page, my mom wrote her name and a date. She was likely in her 20s.

She underlined sentences and starred titles. With a blue pen and ruler, she drew perfect lines. I picture her lying on her bed, reading with an orange translucent ruler.

Opening the book felt like uncovering her thoughts and circumstances. She underlined a passage about dealing with people and dating. She must have been going out with my dad.

I was reluctant to write in books. That felt like a capital sin. Then I opened her book and felt she was sharing success clues.

I want to do the same for my future kids and grandkids. I'm not afraid of writing in books anymore. Writing in margins, starring titles, and underlining passages turn books into time capsules of our thoughts. A legacy for future generations.
