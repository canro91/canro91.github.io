Like any other form of art, writing requires daily practice.

Seth Godin has been doing it daily for over 20 years. Daily! That's more than 7,000 posts.

But I know, life throws us curveballs. Unexpected things happen. And some days, writing feels impossible. On those days, we feel like letting the chain break.

There are still writing-related tasks (that are not writing) we can do on those days. Here are 10:

1. Proofread and edit future posts.
2. Find cover images or create visuals.
3. Steal headlines, hooks, and opening lines.
4. Repost top-performing posts in social media.
5. Hand-write book passages (or posts) from your favorite writers.
6. Audit posts from past days: What headlines did you use? What type of visuals?
7. Collect your most liked comments and turn them into separate posts or headlines.
8. Tweak low-performing posts: Create new visuals, change headlines, or add new stories.
9. Turn long-form content into short-form content or vice-versa: Blog posts or newsletters into Tweets or LinkedIn posts.
10. Repurpose top-performing posts: Turn a blog post into a LinkedIn carousel or create quote images from it.

Even if you don't write daily, at least do anything writing-related. But never miss two days in a row. Otherwise, like any other muscle, your writing muscles will atrophy.
