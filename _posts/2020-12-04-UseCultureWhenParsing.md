title: TIL&colon; Always Use a Culture When Parsing Numeric Strings in C#
tags: todayilearned csharp

This week, I reinstalled the operating system of my computer. The new version uses Spanish, instead of English. After that, lots of unit tests started to break in one of my projects. The broken tests verified the formatting of currencies. This is what I learned about parsing numeric strings and unit tests.

**To have a set of always-passing unit tests, use a default culture when parsing numeric strings**. Instead of using the plain `Parse` and `ToString` methods on decimals, add a default culture with these two methods. As an alternative, you could wrap your tests in a helper method to set the appropriate culture to run your tests.

Some of the failing tests looked like the one below. These tests verified the separator for each supported currency in the project.

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void ToCurrency_IntegerAmount_FormatsAmountWithTwoDecimalPlaces()
{
    decimal value = 10M;
    var result = value.ToCurrency();

    Assert.AreEqual("10.00", result);
}
```

And, this was the `ToCurrency` method.

```csharp
public static string ToCurrency(this decimal amount)
{
    return amount.ToString("0.00");
}
```

The `ToCurrency` method didn't specify any culture. It used the user's current culture. And, the test expected `.` as the separator for decimal places. It wasn't the case for the culture I was using after resintalling my operating system. The separator for my locale was `,`. That's why those tests failed.

To make sure my failing tests always passed, no matter the culture being used, I added a default culture when parsing numeric strings.

For example, you can create `ToCurrency` and `FromCurrency` methods like this:
    
```csharp
public static class FromattingExtensions
{
    private static CultureInfo DefaultCulture
        = new CultureInfo("en-US");

    public static string ToCurrency(this decimal amount)
    {
        return amount.ToString("0.00", DefaultCulture);
    }

    public static decimal FromCurrency(this string amount)
    {
        return decimal.Parse(amount, DefaultCulture);
    }
}
```

Voil√†! That's what I learned after reinstalling the operating system of my computer and running some unit tests. For other tips on writing unit tests, you can check [How to write good unit tests]({% post_url 2020-11-02-UnitTestingTips %})

_All tests turned green!_
