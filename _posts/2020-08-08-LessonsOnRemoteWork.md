title: Ten lessons learned after one year of remote work
tags: career
---

It's been a year since I started to work remotely. These are the lessons I learned.

### For employers, leaders or managers

**Give clear instructions**. State what you expect and when you expect it. Make sure to say the day, time and timezone, if needed. _"Tomorrow morning"_ is at a different time in different parts of the world. Have in mind that probably everyone in your team isn’t a native speaker of your language. 

**Don’t expect new team members to follow unclear code conventions**. A new developer will pick conventions from existing code instead of an old document.

**Make new developers pair with another team members**. On the onboarding process, a new member will feel more comfortable talking to another developer. Make new developers free to ask any questions about the new team, company product or anything else.

**Have your developers up and running as quickly as possible**. You don’t want them to scratch their heads trying to install the right version of your tools and projects. Create README files, install scripts or anything else that helps to setup the working environment. Anyone should start using your projects by pressing a button or running an script.

### For employees or workers

**Control noise and light in your environment** Have a high-quality headset. Reduce the background noise as much as you can. Make sure to mute and unmute your microphone when appropriate. _You're muted, John!_ Position yourself in a way people won't appear walking in the back. Light up your environment to clear your face.

**Strive to have the best level you can in the language spoken at work**. Have a good pronunciation. This would make things easier for everyone. You don't want to be the guy nobody wants to work with because his speaking skills.

**Separate work and personal spaces**. At the end of your day, do something that signals the end of the day. Sit in the couch, meditate, go for a walk or chance your clothes.

**Schedule regular pauses**. When working in a office, you can grab a coffee or tap into a colleague shoulder. But, while at home, you could be sitting for hours without even realizing it. Set an alarm, stand and walk!

**Connect with others.** You could be working from home for weeks without getting outside. Don't be home alone! Interact with others! Call your friends, go out with your family, work from a coworking space. _At the time of writing, we are at home due to COVID-19 disease. But, this advice is still applicable, staying at home and keeping social distancing_

**Before presentations, turn off auto updates and notifications**. You don’t want your computer to restart updating the operating system in the middle of a presentation or an important meeting. _This is a true story happened to a friend of a friend of mine_

_Happy remote work!_
