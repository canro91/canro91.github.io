For writers, the real challenge is to make readers finish books.

TikTok, Instagram, and endless feeds have turned us into skimmers. And as [Smart Brevity]({% post_url 2026-01-07-SmartBrevity %}) says, our job as writers is to adapt to how readers consume content. [Give them something fast]({% post_url 2025-10-19-WritingPrinciples %}).

Short non-fiction books, or [mini books]({% post_url 2025-10-07-MiniBooks %}), are the answer for impatient readers.

A book doesn't need 30,000 words. It could be [a summary of 10 papers]({% post_url 2024-12-27-WritingABook %}), [a collection of personal stories]({% post_url 2025-04-22-BookForGrandkids %}), or your best posts—as long as it's valuable even for one person, it's worth publishing.

And to my surprise, after going down a rabbit hole, today I found a one-page book, _This Book is One Page Long_ by Hassan Osman. Well, the book has 5 pages. I guess that's the front matter, back matter, and one page of actual content.

If that doesn't kill every excuse for writing a book, nothing will.
