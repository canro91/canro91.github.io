There are 7 billion people and 7 billion unique fingerprints.

This means that anything you put your fingerprint on is unique.

To start your creative journey, recreate something you like, by adding or subtracting your own taste. You will put your fingerprint on it. You will make it unique.

I'm putting my fingerprint on this idea. I found it in Reinvent Yourself by [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}). He found it somewhere else. He put his fingerprint on it and now I'm putting mine.

That relieves the pressure of coming up with something original. Just put your fingerprint on something.

You find a quote? Put your fingerprint on it by rephrasing it and adding your own taste.

You find an interesting book passage? Put your fingerprint on it by sharing it along with a story.

Sooner or later, people will find your "fingerprinted" versions and follow your work by your own fingerprints.

Take the challenge of putting your fingerprint on something every day. I'm putting my fingerprint on a corner of the Internet with every post.
