Too much of anything is bad. Except for writing.

Here are 10 more ideas to write or blog moreâ€”I say "10 more" because I've already shared [2 ideas to write more]({% post_url 2024-11-13-BlogMore %}):

**#1. Write shorter posts.** Instead of writing a 1,000 or 2,000-word post, write multiple 200 or 500-word posts and make them a series.

**#2. If you write a listicle ("10 tips to ..." or "10 lessons I learned from ..."), expand some items in separate posts.** I used this technique when I wrote about [Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth]({% post_url 2025-01-19-ChooseYourselfGuideToWealth %}) and [my alternative to to-do lists]({% post_url 2025-01-11-DitchingTodos %}).

**#3. Write tangents in a separate post.** When you're writing and notice you're going on a tangent, don't delete it. Use it as a starting point for another post.

**#4. Turn your "cuts" into posts.** When you're editing or proofreading, don't throw away the sentences or paragraphs that didn't make it into the final piece. They're ideas for separate posts.

**#5. Update old posts in new posts.** If the subject of a post has changed significantly since the first time, write an updated version and add an "update" disclaimer to the original one.

**#6. Take notes publicly** after finishing  a book or listening to a podcast episode. I do this all the time. Just look at [my books tag](/tags/books/). You could summarize it, react to it, or collect your favorite quotes and tell stories around them.

**#7. Answer private questions in public.** Every time I get a message on my contact page or a private text message with an interesting question, I expand my response into a post. Of course, editing out anything that can't be shared in public. That's how [I preserve my keystrokes]({% post_url 2024-11-09-LimitedKeystrokes %}).

**#8. Answer Reddit, Hacker News, or Quora questions on your own post.** When you find a question that you can answer, write your own "answer" post. I did this when I wrote about [my life-changing purchases since 2020]({% post_url 2024-12-12-LifeChangingPurchases %}). That was a question I found on Hacker News.

**#9. Turn old comments into posts.** Review the comments you've left on social media and forums and expand your comments into posts. Especially use those comments that got good engagement.

**#10. Steal topics from others.** This is a variation of #8. When you're reading something and you realize you could have written that post, stop reading and write your own. Steal the topic, but not the content. I did this when I wrote about the lessons I learned from [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant]({% post_url 2024-11-29-ReadingMore %}).

There's no bad consequence of writing more. [Volume always wins]({% post_url 2025-03-17-VolumeWins %}).
