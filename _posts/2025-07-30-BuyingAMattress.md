_"Sorry, it's too late. There's nothing to do,"_ a salesgirl told me.

## The mattress

Earlier that day, the mattress I had ordered was delivered. I was told I should get it assembled and ready to use. But the delivery man told me, _"I was hired only to deliver this to you."_

I tried to contact the company by dialing the phone number on the invoice. It didn't work. It was either wrong or constantly busy. I checked their website for a phone number. No luck!

Then I rushed back to the mall where I bought it. The salesgirl called her supervisor. I wasn't the only one receiving a mattress in pieces that day.

_"If you had called me right away, maybe I could have done something,"_ she told me. After telling me it was too late, she explained that my mattress was delivered from another city via another delivery company. _"Hey, but it isn't that hard for you to assemble the mattress. It has some instructions inside."_ Arrggg!

## The lesson

If you promise something on your sales pages, deliver that promise. And make sure everyone involved understands what they need to do to make it a reality.

Imagine KFC handing you raw chicken and telling you, _"You can fry it on your own. It comes with a step-by-step. It's not that difficult."_ You would never visit that restaurant again. Just like I'll never trust that mattress company again.

There's no secret to business, just promise, then deliver.
