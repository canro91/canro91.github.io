title: "Keeping Your Phone Around Reduces Your Cognitive Capacities"

That was the result of [a study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691462) by the University of Texas, cited in the book "The Anxious Generation."

In the study, they divided an undergraduate classroom into thirds.

One third left their phones in another room. Another third kept them in their pockets or bags. And the last third kept them facing down on their desks.

Guess who performed best at the end of some cognitive tests?

Of course, the third that kept their phones outside did best. And the other two thirds did poorly, with some differences depending on the tests. But they claimed that their phone's presence didn't affect their performance.

The mere presence of their phones reduced their cognitive abilities, even when they were silent or off.

If you have read Deep Work, you already know about monk mode. But to focus, you don't have to go into strict mode and retreat to a cabin without reception in the middle of nowhere. Just ask your phone to give you some space. Leave your phone in another room, out of sight.

Now, while I'm typing this, my phone is in airplane mode, in another room.

So if you want to do focused work, leave your phone out of sight.
