Burnout brought stomach issues I couldn't ignore.

In 2023, one day, I suddenly had to rush to the bathroom after eating. I wanted to finish my work so fast that I skipped meals and developed poor eating habits.

After many doctor visits, here's a compilation of [10 ideas]({% post_url 2024-11-05-IdeaMachine %}) for better digestion and eating habits. 

1. Eat at consistent times.
2. Eat liquids and solids separately.
3. Chew every bite at least 10 times.
4. Remove distractions like phones and news while eating.
5. Follow the right order to avoid [glucose spikes]({% post_url 2026-01-21-GlucoseSpikes %}).
6. Stop before you're completely full.
7. Pause briefly after finishing.
8. Drink water with lemon or apple cider 30 minutes before meals.
9. Drink chamomile or spearmint tea after eating. Spearmint tea is my favorite.
10. Leave at least 12 hours between dinner and breakfast.

A word of caution: this is not medical advice, just what worked for me.
