title: "Two Blogging Tips to Write More"

Inspired by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/) and [Herbert Lui](https://herbertlui.net/), I looked up other people writing daily on their personal blogs and found these two pieces of advice:

## 1. If it's longer than a Tweet, 280 characters, it can be a post.

That's from Mike Crittenden's [2 months of daily blogging](https://critter.blog/2020/09/28/2-months-of-daily-blogging/).

Post length doesn't matter if we transmit the message clearly in a few words. A post can simply be a headline and a main idea. Don't feel guilty about short posts.

## 2. Instead of leaving a comment, write a reaction post and share a link instead.

A reaction post, even a short one, is calmer and thoughtful. Often, we write most comment in "the heat" of reading or without even reading the entire piece.

That sounds like one tip to [never run of writing ideas]({% post_url 2024-09-09-WritingIdeas %}) and a way to [preserve keystrokes]({% post_url 2024-11-09-LimitedKeystrokes %}).
