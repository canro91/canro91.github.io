It took me almost half a day to come up with yesterday's subject.

That was after claiming, a few days ago, that [writer's block is not the real problem]({% post_url 2025-02-16-ForgetWritersBlock %}). Well, it took me more than usual to mark the calendar yesterday, even after looking for inspiration in past posts and half-baked ideas. I ended up writing about one of my recent frustrations: [Hourly billing]({% post_url 2025-02-20-HourlyBillingIsNuts %}).

In case you're like me yesterday, struggling to find what to write about, here's a list of prompts to help you write today.

1. Expand an old post.
2. Dissect a book passage.
3. Describe what's around you.
4. Turn [a 10-idea list]({% post_url 2024-11-05-IdeaMachine %}) into a post.
5. Write about your favorite quote.
6. Summarize your favorite podcast episode.
7. Write a letter to your past or future self.
8. Expand one of your comments on social media into a post.
9. Answer a question from Reddit, Quora, or any other forum.
10. Set a timer and write about whatever comes to your mind.
11. Open your browser history and compile the answers you found.
12. Scroll through YouTube or any other feed and write a reaction post.

Even if you don't have anything to write, don't miss two days without practicing. Your writing muscle will atrophy. And here's a [list of tasks for the days you don't feel like writing]({% post_url 2025-02-07-WritingTasks %}).
