Here are 8 things I believe you should never feel bad about, no matter what:

**#1. Saying no.** To negativity, toxic relationships, bad jobs... To anything your gut instinct doesn't like.

**#2. Choosing an unproven path.** [There's a default plan]({% post_url 2025-05-07-LifeLesson %}) set for you if you don't choose yours.

Go to college, get a job, work hard, keep your head down, and retire. That worked for our parents. Not anymore.

It's okay to start a small business, create content, or freelance instead of following the 9-5 path.

**#3. Putting yourself first.** If you don't take care of yourself, nobody will. And life is often like airplane safety measures: put your oxygen mask on first, before helping others.

**#4. Buying books.** From _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ by Ramit Sethi, I learned to cut what we hate and spend on what we love. If that means buying books, so be it.

**#5. Avoid spending on luxury items.** Who needs the expensive watch, designer clothes, or fancy wallet? Often, people go into debt to pay for those items. And if it doesn't put money into your pockets, it's a liability. (Credits to [Poor Dad Rich Dad]({% post_url 2025-01-05-MoneyBooks %}).) And it's okay to cut it.

**#6. Traveling.** Apart from visiting new places, [traveling teaches you new languages]({% post_url 2020-10-23-ThreeLanguageLessons %}) and to expand your horizons. The world isn't like your small town. People don't think like you. And that's okay.

**#7. Being single.** I don't remember where I heard it, but most people start relationships simply because they feel alone. For that, it's better to find a hobby or new friends than to start a relationship that might hurt someone.

**#8. Promoting your own work.** Sometimes we debate sports, politics, or why Apple phones beat Samsung phones, but hesitate to promote our own work. Like it or not, we're selling all the time. And if we don't sell something, [we'll end up selling our time]({% post_url 2025-05-10-Selling %}). And we're not going to like it.
