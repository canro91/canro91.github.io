Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. Is AI really taking our jobs? Here's a breakdown of papers and historical records to prove that the ["AI taking jobs" hype is more a marketing strategy](https://sparktoro.com/blog/ai-will-replace-all-the-jobs-is-just-tech-execs-doing-marketing/) (12min) than anything else. There's nothing to worry about (yet?) after all.

#2. There's a difference between [being helpful and being valued at work](https://betterthanrandom.substack.com/p/if-you-are-useful-it-doesnt-mean) (4min). One of the two leads to stagnation in our careers.

#3. AI has made it easier to start coding or writing. [The real differentiator isn't technical skills, but judgment](https://notsocommonthoughts.com/blog/ai-and-judgement/) (3min). The real question is knowing what to build.

#4. Here's [a complete guide on prompt engineering](https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-prompt-engineering-playbook-for) (38min) tailored for software engineers, with good and bad examples of prompts. It looks more like a mini-course. Definitely something to keep returning every time we need to write a prompt for a coding task.

As a bonus, I found [this absurd website](https://absurd.website) with funny and absurd project ideas. I think I could use the Lucky Cat to bring more luck to [my Gumroad store](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/). That one isn't so absurd.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [7 strategies to stay sane in this AI-hype cycle]({% post_url 2025-06-03-Hype %}) (3min) and [12 nightmares every coder faces]({% post_url 2025-05-31-Nightmares %}) (3min).
