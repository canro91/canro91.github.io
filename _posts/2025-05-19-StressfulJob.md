A stressful job can take a serious toll on your mental health.

I know because I've had one. In that job, we were chasing our own deadlines, our clients' expectations, and local government regulations. We were late all the time. Everyone blamed the Development team. Leaders constantly pressured us.

Working after hours was normal. We called them "Miracle Nights." In one night, we did way more than we did in a sprint. You can imagine the amount of technical debt we were leaving behind.

While working on that job, I ate [the most expensive hamburgers I've ever had]({% post_url 2024-12-11-SelfManagedTeam %}), by the way.

## But there was something that made everything easier

Our relationships and friendships made all the difference.

It was having someone who could listen, a group for Friday nights, and friends who could refer you to new jobs. That support changed everything.

Even though it was one of my most stressful jobs, I did the most to take care of my mental health while working there. It was easier because I had a "support group," coworkers that eventually turned into friends.

If you're working on a stressful job or not, make an extra effort to build those professional relationships. The world runs on connections. And in the end, we're remembered not just for our work, but for how we treat those around us.
