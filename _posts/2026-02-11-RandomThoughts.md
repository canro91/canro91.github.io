Even on [a phone reduction diet]({% post_url 2026-01-22-LessScrolling %}), and even [using social media consciously]({% post_url 2026-01-19-LinkedIn %}), I found myself wondering what to write next. I had too much on my mind.

To offload my mind, here's a single-take brain dump of random ideas I've found recently:

**#1. Nothing can't be done by thinking alone.** That's a line I found in _Secrets to Thrive in Life_, a book [my mom annotated]({% post_url 2026-01-20-WritingInBooks %}) and left behind.

**#2. Don't network. Write instead.** Your words have wider reach than a networking activity or event. Someone shared in Medium.

**#3. A fit, shredded body is a status symbol.** A fancy house, car, and watch can be financed, but not a healthy body. Allegedly Arnold Schwarzenegger.

**#4. The bigger the project, the strongest the Resistance.** Resistance being the personification of doubt, procrastination, and self-sabotage. From the one and only, Steven Pressfield.

**#5. When stressed/anxious/overwhelm, create.** Someone else in Medium.

**#6. You don't owe the Internet consistency.** It's OK to disappear from social media. A creator I follow in LinkedIn.

**#7. Journaling can be as simple as writing one line a day.** Ryan Holiday from his YouTube channel.
