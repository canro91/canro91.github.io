Question: Guys, how do I say "I love you" in Japanese?

— Japanese? Why don't you try German? It's easier in German

— If you want to talk about love, you should try with French

— Yeah, go with French. That's the language of love

...Question downvoted

— Wait, isn't Spanish the language of love?

— Guys, the thing is I have this text at work and I need to say that in Japanese

— Really? What kind of job is that? You should talk to your boss and tell him to use a real language for that

— Do you call yourself a language lover and don't know that?

...Question closed as duplicate.
