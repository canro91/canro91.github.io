I've been binge-watching Ryan Holiday's videos.

YouTube took me to his appearance on the [Joe Rogan Experience](https://youtu.be/_PMesNbFuFQ)

I watched the whole 2-hour video over a couple of days. It's long and not always about stoicism and books. But there was a gem I found really inspiring.

Joe shared his "secret:" he only invites guests he finds interesting and his only metric is if he does something engaging and entertaining for his audience.

He started the podcast to meet interesting people. And even after it made money, he kept the same strategy.

[I've been writing online for years]({% post_url 2023-07-18-FiveYearsOfBlogging %}). A big follower count seems attractive. But that interview reminded me to stay grounded. Do interesting things and have fun. Everything else is a plus.

Oh, this reminded me of [the creative rules from the guys behind Field Notes]({% post_url 2025-06-30-CreativeProjects %}).
