During a recent hospital visit, I found inspiration to write.

To keep my mind busy and productively distracted, I thought about [how to calm my mind]({% post_url 2025-04-19-CalmDown %}) and imagined [how hospital visits might look in 2035]({% post_url 2025-04-20-MedAI %}).

From that one and other experiences, I've learned 9 completely random things recently:

## About health

**#1. Insulin helps decrease potassium levels.** When we hear insulin, we think of diabetes. But it turns out insulin helps the body absorb potassium faster. At least, that's what a doctor explained to us.

**#2. Anemia isn't only because of iron deficiency.** It's one of the causes, not the main one. It could be due to genetic reasons or red blood cells dying too soon or bone disorders.

**#3. Too much exercise before bed interrupts your sleep patterns.** I found this on [a study](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-bed-linked-disrupted.html) on the front page of Hacker News. This isn't to discourage exercise. It's about comparing some exercise to high-intensity exercise within 4 hours before bed.

## About well-being

**#4. When rushing, life makes you slow down.** In 2023, while finding ways to [recover from burnout]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}), I read "The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry" by John Mark Comer. There was a line that has lived rent-free in my mind since then: _"God [or Nature or Universe] didn't create hurry."_ I had to remember that recently.

**#5. Don't check your phone first thing in the morning.** These days, for some reason, I checked WhatsApp after waking up and before doing any productive work. I couldn't focus after that. Arrggg!

## About writing

**#6. Use Fear/Curiosity/Desire to write attention-grabbing headlines.** Credits to [Ron Markley on Medium](https://ronwayjourney.medium.com/fewer-than-1-000-followers-heres-your-headline-guide-zero-views-to-100-views-5838d42ea982). Recently I've learned that when we write content, we're in the business of [writing headlines]({% post_url 2024-12-17-BetterHeadlines %}). No matter how thoughtful our content is, if the headline doesn't hook readers, they won't stop to read it.

**#7. When writing stories or fiction, a point in time creates expectations in the readers' minds.** When we write _"It was a sunny summer day when I saw her for the first time..."_ readers expect to hear more about what happened. Avoid abrupt shifts that break readers' expectations. It's like cutting off a gossip mid-way.

**#8. Listicles attract higher engagement on social media.** Listicles do work online and offline. The 10 commandments, 95 theses by Luther, the 48 laws of power... Since last year, I've been experimenting on LinkedIn. And listicles have worked like a charm. My most viewed post was something like _"10 career lessons I've learned in the last 10 years (in less than 1 minute)"_ followed by 10 one-liners. People tend to comment on the item that resonated the most.

**#9. One single post can boost your follower count.** You know the Pareto principle, right? 80% of results come from 20% of effort. Well, 80% of followers and engagement come from 20% of posts. And one viral post can boost your follower count. It has happened to me on LinkedIn and Medium recently.
