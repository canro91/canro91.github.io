It's clear when you're taking a relationship seriously.

You spend time with your loved one and stop looking for somebody else.

But what about a creative project? What does taking writing, painting, or coding seriously mean?

[I started writing in 2018]({% post_url 2020-07-18-HowIStartedBlogging %}), but I didn't treat it seriously until 2024.

For me, taking my writing seriously meant:
* [Showing up consistently]({% post_url 2024-12-14-Consistency %})
* Studying other writers' work
* Putting my writing in front of others
* Challenging myself out of my comfort zone
* Writing about other subjects apart from coding
* Hanging around other writers online
* [Buying my first writing course]({% post_url 2024-12-26-WriteDaily %})
* Listening to feedback

With those actions, writing stopped being something I did only in my spare time and when inspiration struck to become part of my everyday rhythm. They help me build the confidence to [call myself a "writer."]({% post_url 2025-01-23-CallingYourselfAWriter %})

Taking a creative project seriously means committing it by showing up and working on improving your skills.
