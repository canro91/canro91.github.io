Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. Microsoft has made a lot of noise this week. It laid off around ~6K people. And it made [the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/05/19/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-is-now-open-source/) (5min) and [the Copilot Chat extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/05/19/openSourceAIEditor) (8min) open source. It seems the layoffs and the release of open source aren't related. At least, that's the official version.

#2. Speaking of Microsoft, they enabled Copilot on the Runtime repository. And it seems [AI can't fix simple bugs](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-scam) (4min).

#3. It seems I'm not the only one who doesn't like it when web apps use [my location to decide what language to use](https://vitonsky.net/blog/2025/05/17/language-detection/). There's already a better alternative to using IP addresses.

#4. One of the most common mistakes when writing tests is duplicating the logic under test inside assertions. That's what's called [circular reasoning](https://laser-coder.net/articles/circular-reasoning/index.html) (7min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [stop optimizing for scale when we don't need it]({% post_url 2025-05-17-NeedForScale %}) (2min) and [the key to survive a stressful job]({% post_url 2025-05-19-StressfulJob %}) (2min).
