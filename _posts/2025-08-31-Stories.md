It’s been so relieving and therapeutic listening to many of my mom’s stories.

My aunt pulled down an old photo album. I was full of joy seeing old photos of my mom as a teenager.

The next day, my sister and I sat down to talk to my mom’s best friend. They meet at 3rd grade and were friends since then. I loved hearing all their child adventures, school days, and teenage loves.

I was surprised by how many stories I heard.  Some of them I didn’t even know.

Those two experiences reminded me that the best way to make an impact and preserve our stories is with a book. And for that, we don’t need a best-seller.
