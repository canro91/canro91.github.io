While scrolling through yesterday's Minifeed for inspiration, I found this blogging challenge on [Living Out Loud](https://louplummer.lol/forking-mad/). Turns out [David, from Forking Mad +](https://forkingmad.blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/), started it. No more writer's block.

Here I go:

## Do you floss your teeth?

Yes. Once a day.

## Tea, coffee, or water?

Coffee only in the mornings with breakfast. No sugar. 1L of water a day. And tea, occasionally after dinner.

## Footwear preference?

Nothing in particular. But I like to [wear shoes without laces when traveling]({% post_url 2025-03-09-TravelTips %}). It saves so much time at security controls.

## Favorite dessert?

I don't have a sweet tooth. But if you're curious, [Arroz con Leche](https://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/arroz-con-leche-rice-pudding/) (Rice pudding. Literally, rice with milk) is a popular dessert in my country.

## The first thing you do when you wake up?

Brush my teeth, a glass of water, and a moment of silence. I started the last two, as part of my Daily Practice, after [ditching my todo lists]({% post_url 2025-01-11-DitchingTodos %}).

## Age you'd like to stick at?

I wouldn't like to stick at any age. Every age comes with challenges to face and lessons to learn. Last year, [I got laid off and recovered from burnout]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}) and I learned some valuable lessons. That was something I wouldn't have learned at any other age.

## How many hats do you own?

Not exactly hats, but I have a couple of baseball caps.

One day, I attended a meeting on Teams at work in a past job. And during a 1-on-1 with the VP of Engineering, he said, "If you want to be a team leader, you should start looking like one." And that meant stopping wearing caps. Leadership required a different look. Arrggg! 

## Describe the last photo you took?

I took a photo of a loved one coming back home after almost a week in a hospital.

## Worst TV show?

I don't have a TV show I'd call "the worst."

Maybe it's because I don't watch that many TV shows. But I will tell you some of my favorite ones: Homeland, The Diplomat, [Scorpion]({% post_url 2024-12-09-Scorpion %}), and Dr. House.

I used to feel guilty about watching TV shows. But I realized when we see the world with our writer's glasses on, [content ideas are everywhere]({% post_url 2025-01-26-ContentIsEverywhere %}). So I started writing about TV shows and movies I watch. No more feeling guilty.

## As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?

I had many ideas: joining the Navy, studying Biology, being a polyglot, and many others I can't even recall. [I've always struggled to find one passion]({% post_url 2024-12-16-FindYourPassion %}).

I also answered the [Bear Blog Questions Challenge]({% post_url 2025-01-13-BlogQuestionsChallenge %}) the other day.
