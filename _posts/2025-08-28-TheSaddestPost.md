title: "The Saddest Post I've Ever Had to Write"

This was supposed to be a 300-day post celebration. But it turned out to be the toughest post I ever had to write.

After five years fighting with chronic kidney disease and two weeks in the hospital, one of the most important people in my life, my mom, passed away a few hours ago.

I'm writing this with tears in my eyes and a deep hole in my soul. We all know these moments will come at some point, but nothing and no one prepares us for them.

Today I want to remember mi mamá with a whole lot of gratitude.

* Thanks mom for teaching me faith
* Thanks mom for fighting so strong for so long
* Thanks mom for showing me love and kindness
* Thanks mom for being the best mom you could ever be
* Thanks mom for sacrificing your career to raising me and my sister
* Thanks mom for worrying about me even when you were sick in a bed too
* Thanks mom for staying up with me to study through the night
* Thanks mom for being there for me when I was sick
* Thanks mom for all that you sacrificed for me
* Thanks mom for the 62 years you were with me

I will always remember you, mamá. All that I am and what I have is because of you.

In the loving memory of Rocío Romero, the best mom God, Life, and the Universe could have given me.

We'll see you again soon.

PS: If heaven is real, there must be a welcoming party there today.
