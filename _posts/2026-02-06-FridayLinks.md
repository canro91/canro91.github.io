Hey there. It's been a wild week in tech.

Here's what stood up:

**#1.** This is crazy. The [Notepad++ update server was compromised](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/hijacked-incident-info-update/) (7min) by Chinese state hackers for part of 2025. Patch yours right away!

**#2.** Now there's a Reddit for AI: Moltbook...or whatever the latest name is. Here's a breakdown of why it's [the most interesting place on the internet](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/30/moltbook/) (7min). Imagine AIs ranting about their tasks. It seems they aren't conspiring against us yet.

**#3.** AI isn't replacing us, just changing our job description. Maybe we won't be coders anymore. [We will be code sculptors](https://www.jerpint.io/blog/2026-01-24-i-dont-write-code-anymore-i-sculpt-it/) (2min). Imagine job descriptions: _"Looking for a 10x Michelangelo to join our amazing family."_

**#4.** The only social media I use is LinkedIn. You probably found me there first. I avoid the feed though. If you want to jump in, here's [a guide on how to use social media mindfully](https://danielleheberling.xyz/blog/mindful-social-media/) (3min).

Thanks to the magic of the internet, a post from December got some traction last week. In case you missed it, here it is: [what we could offer if AI finally takes over]({% post_url 2025-12-21-Offerings %}) (2min).
