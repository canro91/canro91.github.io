Preserve your keystrokes. They're limited.

That's a piece of advice I learned from one of [Scott Hanslman's talks about productivity]({% post_url 2021-12-06-ItsNotWhatYouRead %}).

This isn't an invitation to write less or write shorter content. It's an invitation to make private knowledge public.

Often valuable knowledge and lessons die in email threads or Slack channels. Apart from the original recipients, nobody else can read them. That's how you "waste" your keystrokes.

Make those private email threads or Slack messages public by turning them into wiki entries, tutorials, or blog posts. That's how you preserve your keystrokes.

I'm answering almost all my questions in public to preserve my keystrokes.

The other day, one of my <a href="https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/fridaylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email subscribers</a> replied to one of my emails with a question about writing. I replied and then turned that reply [into a post]({% post_url 2024-09-23-StrugglingToWrite %}).

Another day, a reader contacted me after going through my takeaways from [Ultralearning]({% post_url 2020-07-14-UltralearningTakeaways %}). And again, I expanded my reply [into a separate post]({% post_url 2023-07-24-AdviceToStartAnUltralearningProject %}).

Don't let knowledge die in private channels. Preserve your keystrokes and share a link to a public writing instead.
