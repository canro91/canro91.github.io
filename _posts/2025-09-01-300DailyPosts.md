This is my daily post #304.

The 300-post mark felt hard to complete. I tried to balance multiple writing projects at once. I felt so tired at the end of the day that my writing streak almost suffer. And life threw me a huge unexpected curveball that made me miss a day. I ended up writing two posts the next day to recover.

Finding ideas to write wasn't the challenge. It was finding the time to write.
