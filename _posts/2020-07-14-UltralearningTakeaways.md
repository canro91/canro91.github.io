title: Ultralearning&colon; Takeaways
---

Scott Young describes in Ultralearning the strategy behind his own challenges, like "MIT Challenge in 1 year" and "A year without English". Also, he reveals the methods from some ultralearners, like Benny Lewis with his "Fluent in 3 Month" projects. _What is it all about?_

Ultralearning is an strategy to learn that is self-directed and intense. You want to start an ultralearning project to advance your career or excel at a particular subject. Ultralearning is an alternative to high tuition.

## Before starting

Answer why, what and how you are going to do start an ultralearning project.

### Why?

Identify why you're learning a subject and the effect you want to achieve. Are you learning the subject to get a result? Or are you driven only by curiosity? For example, learn to program to get a promotion vs learn French to go on a trip.

### What?

Identify concepts, facts and procedures:

  * A concept is something you need to understand instead of memorizing
  * A fact is something you need to memorize. It's useful only if you can recall it
  * A procedure is something you need to practice

For example, vocabulary and expressions are facts when learning a foreign language. But, pronunciation is procedural.

### How?

Spend about 10% of your learning time doing research. Find how people are learning that subject. For example, syllabus of courses, textbooks, bootcamps, experts in that field. Filter what won't help you to achieve your goal.

## During

**Learning should be in the context where those skills will be applied**. It's doing the thing you want to get good at where most of the learning happen. For example, doing problem sets instead of watching lectures. Or learning languages through conversations instead of vocabulary lists. You can try project-based learning or immerse learning. For example, learn how to create a website in a month or going on a trip to learn a language.

**Spread shorter study sessions over a longer period**. Find a balance between long sessions of study in a topic and shorter sessions in different subjects. It's better to have shorter sessions between 15 minutes and an hour. If you find yourself procrastinating, follow the **5-minute rule**: start and sustain for 5 minutes. Also, you can try the **Pomodoro technique**: spread 25-minute sessions of practice between 5-minute breaks.

**Identify the bottleneck components in your learning**. Separate your skill into sub-skills. And practice each sub-skill . Like a musician who practice tricky parts of a piece in isolation and then practice everything.

**Recall is better than concept maps and passive note reviewing**. Recall concepts and facts. Your memory is a leaky bucket. Try space-repetition software or flashcards. After watching a lecture, write all you can remember. When practicing, avoid using your resources.
