Scott Young describes in Ultralearning the strategy behind his own learning challenges, like "MIT Challenge in 1 year" and "A year without English". Let's learn what Ultralearning is all about.

**Ultralearning is an strategy to learn that is self-directed and intense.** Ultralearning projects helps you to advance your career or excel at a particular subject. Ultralearning is a perfect alternative to traditional learning methods.

## Before starting

Before starting an ultralearning project, answer why, what and how you are going to ultralearn.

### Why?

First, identify why you're learning a subject and the effect you want to achieve. Are you learning the subject to get an specific result? Are you driven only by curiosity?

For example, are you learning to code to get a promotion? Or, do you want to learn a new language to go on a trip? Those are two different motivations.

### What?

Next, determine the concepts, facts and procedures you need to learn.

  * A **concept** is something you need to understand instead of memorizing
  * A **fact** is something you need to memorize. Facts are useful only if you can recall it later
  * A **procedure** is something you need to practice

For example, learning vocabulary and expressions are facts when learning a foreign language. But, pronunciation is procedural.

### How?

After answering Why and What, select your resources. Spend about 10% of your learning time doing research. Find how people are learning that subject.

Look for syllabus of courses, textbooks, bootcamps, experts in that field. Filter what won't help you to achieve your goal.

## During

### Learn in context

Learning should be in the context where those skills will be applied. It's doing the thing you want to get good at where most of the learning happen. For example, solve problem sets instead of watching lectures and learn a language through conversations instead of vocabulary lists.

Try project-based learning and immerse learning. For example, learn how to create a website in a month or go on a trip to learn a new language.

### Prefer short study sessions

Spread shorter study sessions over a longer period. Find a balance between long sessions of study in a topic and shorter sessions in different subjects. It's better to have shorter sessions between 15 minutes and an hour.

If you find yourself procrastinating, follow the **5-minute rule**: start and sustain for 5 minutes. Also, you can try the **Pomodoro technique**: spread 25-minute sessions of practice between 5-minute breaks.

### Identify bottlenecks

Identify the bottleneck components in your learning. Separate your skill into sub-skills. And practice each sub-skill . Like a musician who practice tricky parts of a piece in isolation and then practice everything.

### Recall instead of concept mapping

Recall is better than concept maps and passive note reviewing. Recall concepts and facts. Your memory is a leaky bucket. Try space-repetition software or flashcards. After watching a lecture, write all you can remember. When practicing, avoid using your resources.
