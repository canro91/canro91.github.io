You don't need a publisher and 100,000 words to write a book that matters.

[Chris Stanley](https://substack.com/@minibookmodel) was the one who finally debunked my ideas about [writing books]({% post_url 2025-07-22-Books %}). He's the author of 20 Amazon best-sellers. He lives off his books, traveling around the U.S. in a boat. He's the "Mini Book" guy and now he teaches how to write them.

Today I attended a workshop with Chris, where he showed a glimpse of his method. Here are 10 lessons I learned:

**#1. Don't think of funnels, think of a flywheel.** Think of an ecosystem of content, with mini-books at its core, that changes people's beliefs and turns them into fans.

**#2. Forget about writing the next New York Times best seller.** When Chris started publishing his books, he noticed his shorter books did better. It's not a coincidence. 75% of people don't finish the books they buy.

The solution? Write mini-books. Just the good parts of a traditional book.

**#3. A mini-book offers one solution to one problem for one person.** Your solution should be something you've tried and proven yourself. The more specific your person, the better.

**#4. A mini-book should be SMART:**
* Structured: It should be well structured and easy to follow.
* Mini: A word count isn't the goal, but a mini-book usually has between 10-15K words. Write a book readers can finish in one or two hours.
* Actionable: It should offer a solution your readers can apply immediately.
* Repeatable: It should present a message easy to remember and share.
* Transformational: It shouldn't only teach something, but should change beliefs.

For example, Chris' _Mini Book Model_ has only 129 pages and he breaks down his model so you can write a book in days, not months.

**#5. There are only 3 people to write a book for:**
1. Who you were: That's your past self. Maybe that's a first-time business owner or a junior coder.
2. Who you are: That's your current self, your identity, and what you do now.
3. Who you love: That's someone you care about and want to help. Chris once wrote a book for his wife. And we could write [a book for our future generations]({% post_url 2025-04-22-BookForGrandkids %}).

**#6. Write a clever title and a clear subtitle.** Once you have a problem and solution, your title should create a hook and your subtitle should create a promise. For example, _Mini Book Model: How to Write Your Big Ideas in Small Books_

**#7. There are three ways to outline a book:**
1. W's: That's the what, when, where, why, and how. Write a chapter to answer each question. For a book about mini-books, the first chapter could be what a mini-book is. The next chapter, why write a mini-book.
2. Step by step: Write one step of your solution per chapter.
3. Problem/solution: Each chapter presents a problem and offers a solution.

Again, in _Mini Book Model_, Chris used the W's technique to present his mini-book concept.

**#8. Make your solution memorable.** If you're using the step-by-step outline technique, use an acronym or a visual metaphor to guide your readers and help them remember your solution.

**#9. As a bonus, use chapters of your next book as preview.** It makes your book thick enough to display your name and title on the spine.

**#10. Not only write books, but create a whole identity and brand around them.** After 20 books or more, Chris is the "Mini Book" guy. His emails, tagline, and even book titles use the same concept. Mini-books everywhere. That's how he stands out.
