I wrote my first blog post in 2018. Well, it was more of a word vomit pretending to be a coding tutorial.

I've been writing [a daily post since November 1st, 2024]({% post_url 2025-09-01-300DailyPosts %}). And in the last year, I've written over [300 LinkedIn posts]({% post_url 2025-06-15-LinkedIn %}).

By pure accident or luck, [I made my first $1 online]({% post_url 2025-10-12-1DollarTest %}) thanks to my writing.

After all these years, I've adopted the following 5 guiding principles to keep writing:

## #1. If it helps one person, hit post.

You don't need to write to the masses. Just to one person. And that one person could be your past self.

## #2. Give something and give it fast.

In 17ms, we decide if we keep reading or move on. Credits to _Small Brevity_.

Online writing (emails, social media posts, or blog posts) isn't fiction. People expect a long detailed description of scenery and dialog in a novel. Even in fiction, if your story isn't moving fast enough, readers will put your book aside.

Get to the point! [Nail your headlines]({% post_url 2025-07-15-Headlines %}) and [work on your opening lines]({% post_url 2025-06-04-OpeningLines %}). Cut the long intros.

## #3. Write as if nobody's reading. Keep writing because you never know who is.

Writing feels lonely when you start.

The cure? [Write for your younger self]({% post_url 2025-10-08-PastSelf %}). Write what you wish you had known 2 years ago.

## #4. Don't wait to become an expert. Write to become one.

If you wait to become an expert, you'll never write while [putting in the 10,000 hours]({% post_url 2025-05-27-SkipTheLine %}).

Instead, write to learn. Document your journey. Teach as you go.

## #5. Intention gets you started. A system keeps you showing up.

Writing can feel easy, especially with AI. Consistency is the real challenge.

Find ways to capture ideas and turn them into posts.

In the end, intention starts the journey. But attitude, systems, and habits keep it going.
