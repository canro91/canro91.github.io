"Hey, how's your LinkedIn posting doing?" he said.

I was at a gathering with some friends and ex-coworkers. "I read your posts. I don't like or comment on them, but I read them."

That was surprising. I wasn't expecting a greeting like that one. That was a small win and encouraged me to [stay consistent and keep showing up]({% post_url 2024-12-14-Consistency %}).

Last year, [I revived my LinkedIn]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}) account and started to use it to share my ideas and build my writing skills in public, instead of simply using it to land new jobs.

When we start writing online, we expect to have thousands of followers, tons of comments, and to become thought leaders in just a couple of days.

For some reason, we don't expect the same when practicing a sport. But we think it's true for social media and writing online.

The first months of writing online are lonely. Nothing happens. Nobody likes or comments on any of our posts. Post after post goes nowhere. Just cricket sounds. We're shouting into the void.

But those first moments are the ones that make us build our persistence muscles and push us to improve our craft. "I didn't make it today. There's another chance tomorrow."

Write as if nobody is reading, and keep writing because you don't know who's reading.
