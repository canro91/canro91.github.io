Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. [Typing isn't the bottleneck](https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/08/15/typing-is-not-the-bottleneck-illustrated/) (2min). With AI in the mix, it seems we're optimizing the wrong variable.

#2. Here's [someone who played the game of a scam job interview](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/a-fake-tech-company-scam-heres-how) (20min) and lived to tell about it.

#3. [Not all side projects have to scale](https://derwiki.medium.com/do-things-that-dont-scale-and-then-don-t-scale-9fd2cd7e2156) (3min) or become the next rising Silicon Valley startup. And that's fine.

#4. If you're looking for alternatives to code reviews on GitHub, here's [how code reviews can be better](https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-08-04-code-review-can-be-better/) (6min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [why now is the best time to learn coding]({% post_url 2025-08-18-TooLateToLearnCoding %}) (2min) and [how to navigate to the root folder of a git repo]({% post_url 2025-08-20-RootFolder %}) (1min).
