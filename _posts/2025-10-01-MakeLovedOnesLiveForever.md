Imagine an FBI agent arresting a Nazi spy while someone else urges his country to declare war against Germany.

That's not a Netflix show. It's a true story [Fernando Labastida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flabastida/) shared on LinkedIn. The two men were his grandparents. Here's [the original post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/flabastida_one-of-them-was-an-fbi-agent-who-arrested-activity-7378742940275318784-urcW).

When I read Fernando's post, my first thought was "this should be a book." Who wouldn't like to read a story about arresting Nazis and the political discussions about Mexico entering WWWII? Yes, this story happened in Mexico.

I suggested he write a book, along with a list of mini-stories to include in that book:
1. **Each of his granddads' backstories.**
2. **The main event of their lives**: arresting the Nazi spy and starting the movement to go to war.
3. **The crossing point of the two stories.** Their daughter and son, respectively, got married. And 40 years later, a family wedding took place in the same building where the Nazi spy was captured.
4. **A summary of what was happening at that time in Mexico** and the other places where the story took place.  It turns out that a German U-boat sank a Mexican oil tanker.
5. **A story of how Fernando found out about his granddads.**

I found that story so intriguing that I imagined the first scene of a book or TV show:

One of his granddads packs to go to Mexico after briefing the FBI top officials, while the other rehearses a speech he's about to give in Mexico City's main square. Of course, that's with time jumps and scene breaks.

Fernando said his granddads have passed away, and only a few relatives know the full story. That story could get lost in newspapers and government archives only journalist read, if he doesn't write it.

A book is the best way to preserve family stories and honor our loved ones. There's no need to [write a New York Times bestseller to tell family stories]({% post_url 2025-04-22-BookForGrandkids %}). Even if only our future kids and grandkids read it, that's enough to keep the story alive.
