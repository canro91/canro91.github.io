I'll remember 2025 as the year I became a writer—and the year I lost my mom.

## The saddest moment

After five years of fighting a chronic disease, she left.

It was the saddest, loneliest moment of my life. It led me to [my toughest post ever]({% post_url 2025-08-28-TheSaddestPost %}).

To honor her memory, my sister and I wrote a book: [Nuestros Recuerdos](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GCMVXL7S) (Our Memories in Spanish).

We compiled my journal entries and her poetry. A friend drew some illustrations. And we found some pictures of her when she was young.

That was our therapy and way to keep her alive in our memory.

2025 was a year of achievements and melancholy, winning and losing, endings and beginnings.

## Some victory dance moments

**#1. My first viral post.** One post about [testing private methods]({% post_url 2024-11-30-TestingPrivateMethods %}) got syndicated or reshared. BOOM! A traffic spike and some ebook sales.

**#2. My first interview.** Well, it wasn't exactly an interview.

The LAX community invited me to [a QA session with their coding students]({% post_url 2025-09-11-ALXSept2025 %}). They're building the next generation of coders and leaders in Africa.

Their community manager found one of my posts and reached out. Another victory for writing.

That interview was the perfect excuse to ask for feedback on my communication skills. A coach taught me [this 4-step framework]({% post_url 2025-09-13-Answering %}) for interviews.

**#3. My first book**, [Street-Smart Coding]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}).

It took about 3 months, from idea to launching. Writing taught me plenty, but promoting taught me more.

I adopted [a simple marketing strategy]({% post_url 2025-10-11-ContentThatSells %}) and passed [the $1 test]({% post_url 2025-10-12-1DollarTest %}).

I translated it to Spanish and published it [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G5XCWKR9).

And with a book came [my first hater]({% post_url 2025-11-02-Haters %}). Someone called me "b1tch" for promoting my book and left a sarcastic comment elsewhere.

The book was a real challenge.

**#4. My first appearance on Hacker News.** Yes, [my blog got syndicated on HN](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=canro91). I didn't make it to the first page. But hey, it's progress.
