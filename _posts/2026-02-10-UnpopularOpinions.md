Vibecoding was bad. But now, AI-assisted coding seems fine.

Nothing sparks more heated discussions than asking coders about best practices. Today, someone I follow on LinkedIn shared his weekend AI experiment to build an app. As usual, "passionate" coders threw virtual stones.

To turn the conversation around, he asked for our unpopular opinions about AI-assisted coding. To avoid burying mine in a comment, here they are:

**#1. Use AI as a calculator.** Only useful if you know what you're doing.

**#2. Don't let AI touch code directly.** That's [my go-to rule for coding with AI]({% post_url 2025-10-14-AIRule %}). Unproductive? Maybe. But it forces me to decompose problems and validates AI-generated code.

**#3. Use AI for opposite tasks.** [This is my most recent rule]({% post_url 2025-10-20-SloppyAI %}):

_If I write code, AI reviews it. If AI generates it, I review it._

According to [a recent Sonar survey]({% post_url 2026-02-06-AIStats %}), only 48% of respondents _always_ check AI-assisted code before committing. _#yolo_ By reviewing, I'm already in the top 50%.

**#4. AI is like a semi-autonomous car.** You trust it to steer, but you never take your hand off the wheel. Otherwise, [AI could be a sloppy coder with bad memory]({% post_url 2025-10-20-SloppyAI %}).

AI alone won't make you a great coder. It only amplifies the skills you already have. That's why I wrote [Street-Smart Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/)—because you need more than syntax to stand out.
