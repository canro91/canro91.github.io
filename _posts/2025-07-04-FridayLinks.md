Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. Five years ago, we only needed "Software Engineer" as a title on LinkedIn to be flooded with "life-changing" opportunities. People jumped in for the money. Tech was booming. But that bubble popped. We're living in [a software engineering squeeze](https://newsletter.manager.dev/p/the-software-engineering-squeeze) (5min).

#2. The most boring part of software projects? It's when we're just closing JIRA tickets instead of solving real problems. It's when we're in [Ticket-Driven Development](https://thecynical.dev/posts/ticket-driven-development/) (4min).

#3. As a coder, you don't have to know every single acronym, framework, or tool. It's fine to [say I don't know](https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/i-dont-know) (3min). But I've learned to rephrame it as "I don't know...yet"

#4. Maybe this is a good excuse to buy augmented reality glasses to [use them as ad-blockers](https://www.tomshardware.com/maker-stem/engineer-creates-ad-block-for-the-real-world-with-augmented-reality-glasses-no-more-products-or-branding-in-your-everyday-life) (3min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [a recovery guide for AI-dependent coders]({% post_url 2025-06-28-AIRecovery %}) (5min) and [the best 3 pieces of advice I've received]({% post_url 2025-06-29-BestAdvice %}) (2min).
