## #1. AI is a powerful calculator in math class

In school, you only use a calculator after years of doing arithmetic by hand.

Even with a calculator, you can't simply enter an entire problem or equation to get an answer. You still work through the steps before speeding up the answer. [Use AI the same way]({% post_url 2025-03-31-AIAndCalculators %}).

Build skills, then leverage AI.

A surgery isn't a task for a single person.

In a surgery, there's a nurse, an anesthesiologist, and a surgeon. I only know from [binge-watching House M.D.]({% post_url 2025-10-27-ProblemSolving %}), but operating rooms are full of specialists.

You're the surgeon and AI is your supporting team. That's why [I use AI outside in a browser tab]({% post_url 2025-10-14-AIRule %}) when coding.

Like calculators and operating rooms, coding with AI requires real skills first. I wrote _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding_ to help you build them. Because you need more than syntax to stand out.
