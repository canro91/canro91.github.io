title: "Why You Should Change Jobsâ€”According to Jesus"

I've finally understood why it's better to change jobs than to ask for a raise.

These days, I was reading [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %})'s archive of posts and I found out about the Jesus' effect. I had already heard about the Doppler effect, the Google effect, and the Butterfly effect. But, not about Jesus' effect.

## The Jesus' effect or just being the "carpenter's son"

According to the Gospels, Jesus was traveling and preaching all over his home country.

In our modern day, he would be on podcast tours, giving TED talks, and running masterminds. He was creating a brand and growing a following. Literally.

His movement was getting larger and larger, with followers and haters.

Until he arrived in his hometown.

He couldn't continue doing any of his work. There, he was only the "carpenter's son." His hometown was the place with the most haters.

At that point, I had already heard about that piece of advice: "Don't ask for a raise, change jobs." I've made the mistake of not following it. Shame on me!

## But then I made the connection between Jesus and changing jobs

Often, the best place to grow is not where you're at now, but somewhere else where people will value you more.

Where you are now, you're probably the database guy or the API guy or the UI guy. That's your perceived value. You're just the "carpenter's son."

That's why most conversations about salary raises die with a "come in 3 or 6 months" or "come after your next performance review." You've reached a glass ceiling in terms of growth and how management and check-signers perceive you at work.

There are no more growth opportunities. No more salary increases. Just the same old grind until you get bored or laid off.

Often, just like Jesus, we find ourselves defined by labels, the "carpenter's son" or whatever label you have at work, and to grow, we have to move to another place. Be like Jesus and find opportunities somewhere else where you're valued more.
