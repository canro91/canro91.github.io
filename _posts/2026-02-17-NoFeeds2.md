title: "Day Two Without Social Media (And Two Lessons On Financial Freedom)"

Dear diary:

Today was my second day without social media. I'm starting to notice the changes. I took notes as the day went by and tracked my feelings.

I started reading another chapter of _Financial Freedom_ by Grant Sabatier. Main lessons?

**#1. Financial freedom is about time.** Having more time for you. Using time to make your money work earlier and for longer.

**#2. Money is infinite.** We can't make more time, but we can always make more money.

After my reading time, I joined a meeting with my contracting client.

I was so tempted to check my email or fire up LinkedIn. That's usually what I do during long, unproductive meetings. That's how my meeting time looked. For this one, my only contribution was, _"Yes, that's correct!"_

Instead of scrolling, I took a receipt and doodled circles. I drew a big circle in the middle, then smaller ones, then smaller ones...until the page was full. That's a drawing exercise I found the other day.

**Big observation:** When I feel like procrastinating, I used to scroll. Now I count to three, finish a tiny task, and sustain for five minutes.
