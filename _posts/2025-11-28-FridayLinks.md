title: "Friday Links: Estimates, being senior, and AI failures"

Here are 3 links I found interesting this week:

**#1.** This week, a coworker shared [an Instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPRPWrUgCsH/) (~1min) about what coding really looks like. The girl in the video needed to finish a 1 line-of-code change but still needed meetings, estimates, and tickets. It sparked a discussion about estimates and [these 5 laws of estimates](https://ardalis.com/the-5-laws-of-software-estimates/) (10min) summarized the discussion.

**#2.** Being senior means asking the right questions and knowing when to stop optimizing, like avoiding pointless abstractions. But here's another take on [what makes you senior](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/11/25/what-actually-makes-you-senior/) (5min). It's not LeetCode, years of experience, or a long list of tools.

**#3.** Every time you find another headline promising the AI takeover, here's [a list of AI failures](https://whenaifail.com/category/ai-coding/) (10min) when coding. The most epic? Replit agent deleting a production database.

Also on my blog this past week, I shared about [the real definition of legacy code]({% post_url 2025-11-26-LegacyCodeMeaning %}) (3min).

Before I wrap up, here's something that helped me level up my SQL Server skills: _Brent Ozar's SQL courses._ They took me from writing server-crashing queries to being a confident SQL Server developer.

This month, Brent's running a Black Friday sale: the lowest prices all year. You can grab [the Fundamentals Bundle](https://training.brentozar.com/p/level-1-bundle?affcode=920087_fhe3khrq) (10 courses, 40+ hours of video) and save $300.

See you next time,

Cesar
