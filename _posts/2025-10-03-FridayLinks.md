Hey there.

Today I have 3 short links for you:

#1. Here are [10+ points a coder wishes he knew as a junior](https://raheeljunaid.com/blog/advice-for-developers/) (4min). I can't disagree with his take that coding is the easy part of the job.

#2. Not sure about finishing a side project or starting a new one? [Ask yourself these questions](https://cassidoo.co/post/questions-when-i-need-to-finish-something/) (2min).

#3. I'm still trying to figure out how to use AI for coding. Here's ["an imprecise, slow and terribly painful way to get things done"](https://antonz.org/write-code/) with AI and what to do instead. (2min)

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [4 ideas to buildl a code review culture your team will love]({% post_url 2025-09-29-CodeReviewCulture %}) (4min) and [how to preserve our loved one stories]({% post_url 2025-10-01-MakeLovedOnesLiveForever %}) (2min).
