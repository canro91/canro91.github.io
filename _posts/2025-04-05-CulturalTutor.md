From cleaning at McDonald's to 1.7 million followers on Twitter/X.

Sheehan Quirke (@CulturalTutor) was trying to find ways to make money writing. His best plan was offering tutoring in literature, architecture, and culture. He started his Twitter/X account to drive traffic to his tutoring gig.

Plot twist? People on Twitter didn't want his tutoring sessions, but his threads.

That's how Sheehan started. He shared his story here:

And here are my lessons from that interview:

**#1. Don't read anything written in the last 50 years.** If you read what everybody else reads, you'll say same the same things as everybody else. And you'll think like everybody else. Find good sources of inspiration.

**#2. Focus on writing good stuff.** Forget about algorithm hacks and engagement pods. Just write.

**#3. Write good hooks.** Our content is competing with memes and 6-pack abs. Our content will pass unnoticed unless we write opening lines that make people stop scrolling. [Steal your hooks from influencers]({% post_url 2024-12-17-BetterHeadlines %}).

**#4. The best way to stay consistent is to always believe you can improve.** Your writing today is practice for better writing tomorrow.

**#5. Find peers who encourage you.** This is what James Altucher calls [finding your EQUALS]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}). People on the same journey who can challenge and encourage you.

**#6. Treat writing as your full-time job.** A young boy who wants to make it to the Major Leagues knows he has to train and practice every day. Writing shouldn't be anything different.

**#7. Focus on one thing.** It's easy to get distracted by too many platforms, pretending to be everywhere. Twitter/X, Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, etc. Focus on one thing in one place. When Sheehan was starting on Twitter/X, he wanted to start a newsletter. That would have distracted from what was working: Twitter threads.

**#8. Find ideas on your daily conversations.** And refine them by talking about them. This sounds like [the 3-strike rule to write posts]({% post_url 2024-09-09-WritingIdeas %}) I found the other day.
