In 2024, I went all in with my writing.

Writing worked like free therapy to recover from burnout. After months of inactivity, I decided to revive my LinkedIn account. I started writing 1 post a week, and of course nothing happened. Then I wrote 2 posts...then 3...until I settled on writing every workday.

Some of my ex-coworkers and friends have noticed some of my posts. They have genuinely asked me how to do it on their own.

Here are some of the myths about writing anywhere online I've heard:

## 1. I'm not an expert

Who's an expert anyway? If you wait to be an expert, you will never start writing.

It takes 10,000 hours to be an expert. Do you have time for that? Write to be an expert, don't wait to be one to start.

## 2. I don't know how to write

Writing takes time to master. But to start, [imagine writing for one person]({% post_url 2024-12-24-WritingVoice %}): a friend, your kid, a coworker, or your dog. Talk out loud and transcribe it. Or imagine you're texting a friend and [write inside a chat app]({% post_url 2025-03-05-WritingVoice %}). 

## 3. I don't want to expose myself

You don't have to share pictures of your feet. Don't write about subjects you wouldn't bring up at work.

## 4. I'm not a native English speaker

Write in your native language.

## 5. I'm not good at explaining things

If you're a coder, you are already good at explaining things. Coding is explaining things to a computer. Try to do the same in writing. Don't try to write like a "writer," share an algorithm. [Start by writing TIL Posts]({% post_url 2025-04-10-TilPosts %})

## 6. I don't have anything to share

If you have learned something in the past 2 years, you have something to share. And [you're already sitting on content ideas]({% post_url 2025-01-26-ContentIsEverywhere %}), you just need to notice them.

## 7. I don't know where to publish

Start on social media. Start writing a tweet or whatever they're called now. Or [try with LinkedIn]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}). It might be cringy, but it has fewer trolls. On LinkedIn, the feeling is the boss is watching, so everybody behaves.

## 8. My boss will find out

Your boss won't care. Your boss is busy pleasing their own bosses. 

## 9. I need my boss's permission

Unless you're planning to write about company secrets, you don't need your boss's permission. You don't need permission from anyone.

In fact, [always write about what you do at work]({% post_url 2024-12-06-AlwaysWriting %}). That's better than claiming you did something on your CV.

## 10. People will make fun of me

Nobody will make fun of you. Just hit publish.

## 11. Nobody will read

You can always read and like your own stuff on social media. Write for your past self, and don't worry if anyone reads.

## 12. What if my writing comes up in future interviews

Congrats! It means someone found and read your stuff. And it will make you memorable. "Oh, the guy who wrote about XYZ."

By writing, you can skip hiring lines. For example, [my blog has done more for me than a portfolio]({% post_url 2025-01-12-BlogVsPortfolio %}).

## 13. I have too many ideas. I can't decide what to post.

Post what you would have liked to read 2 years ago. See what sticks and keep writing about that.

## 14. I sit to write but nothing comes up

OK, that's writer's block. But [that's not the real problem]({% post_url 2025-02-16-ForgetWritersBlock %}). Again, write for your past self. Or [try following writing prompts]({% post_url 2025-02-22-WritingPrompts %}).

## 15. I don't know how to create a website

You don't need a website. Start on social media or social blogs. And if you're a coder and want to start writing, [don't code a blogging engine]({% post_url 2024-09-23-StrugglingToWrite %}).

I don't have a New York Times best-seller and I'm not an expert either and you made it this far. That's the power of writing online. Write as if nobody is reading and keep writing because you don't know who you might help. Start today and see where your words take you.
