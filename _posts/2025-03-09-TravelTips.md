I'm far from collecting enough passport stamps for a world tour.

But, I've traveled abroad more than once. [Thanks to coding]({% post_url 2025-02-04-MakingMoneyCoding %}), I saved enough to visit Spain and France before the pandemic. It was my final exam after [studying French]({% post_url 2020-10-23-ThreeLanguageLessons %}) for a couple of years.

Here are 9 tips I've learned from those travels:

1. **Always pack a jacket**: Last time I was on vacation I visited a tropical country. Of course, I only packed shorts and swimsuits. But once I was thousands of feet in the air and inside a pressurized cabin, I was freezing.

2. **Pack underwear and cleaning essentials in your handbag**: In case, your baggage is lost or delayed. Better safe than sorry.

3. **Visit your favorite destination first**: For my travel to France, Paris was the last city I visited. By the time I got there, I didn't have the energy to walk for hours and visit museums. I missed a lot of must-see places. And I didn't truly enjoy the ones I visited. I was tired. Next time, I'm visiting my favorite destinations first.

4. **Schedule a free day** to wander around, sit in a park, go to a cafe, or simply do nothing. Often, we travel to rest and unplug but we end up exhausted from hours of walking, connecting flights, and museums.

5. **Start with a walking tour**: Often, they're free. Or you can leave a tip at the end of the tour. And you have the chance to ask your tour guide for places to eat and hang around where locals go.

6. **Bring eye masks and earplugs.** Perfect for sleeping on planes or trains...And hostels can get loud sometimes.

7. **If you're crossing the Atlantic, from America to Europe, start your flight in the evening**: This lets you get some sleep on the plane and arrive at your destination with daylight. It reduces the jet lag.

8. **Wear pants that don't need a belt and shoes without laces**. It will save you a lot of time at security controls.

9. **Keep your passport in your bag and only take it out at security checkpoints**. Often there's some stigma associated with our country of origin. I bet the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Colombia isn't Encanto, just like Coco when you think of Mexicoâ€”both Disney movies. Keeping your passport in plain sight invites extra scrutiny from security personnel walking around airports.
