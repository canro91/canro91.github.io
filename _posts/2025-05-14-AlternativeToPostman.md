Postman still isn't opening.

Five minutes after clicking the icon... Nothing. Maybe it's calling home, checking in with the International Space Station, or just ghosting me. Who knows?

Today I found out about [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/), a "Git-integrated, fully offline, and open source API client". A simpler alternative to Postman. I had come across Bruno before but had forgotten about it.

## But, there's an even simpler alternative to Postman and Bruno.

When I want to test a single endpoint, I just:
1. Go to the Network tab on Chrome,
2. Right-click on the request I want to test,
3. Then click on "Copy as cURL (bash)",
4. Then paste it into a Terminal, and
5. Press enter.

[cURL](https://curl.se/) is a "command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs". It comes preinstalled with Git Bash for Windows. And I'm a "terminal Git user," so I keep a terminal open all the time. Way faster than opening an Electron app.

Here are some cURL examples to send data:

```shell
$ curl --json '{"name":"some json here"}' https://example.com`
$ curl -s --json @body.json https://example.com
$ curl -s -i --json @body.json -H "header-name:header-value" https://example.com`
$ curl -d "data to PUT" -X PUT http://example.com/
```

Here's the meaning of those options:

* `--json`: To POST a json request either as a json string or from a file.
* `-s`: Silent mode
* `-i`: To include response headers
* `-k`: To avoid validating SSL certificates. Handy when an ASP.NET Core project has HTTPS redirection.

Et voil√†! No waiting, no upgrades, no paywalled features. cURL is faster and simpler than Postman, which still doesn't open on my computer. I guess it's time to upgrade it or simply use a better alternative.

PS: Turns out Postman finally opened... after an upgrade. Unnecessary drama. Arrggg!
