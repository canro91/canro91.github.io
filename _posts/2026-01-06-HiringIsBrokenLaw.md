If you have a coding blog, sooner or later you'll write a "hiring is broken" post.

Today on r/programming, I saw another one. [I've written mine too]({% post_url 2024-05-27-ApplyingToFaang %}).

Yes, we don't know how to hire. Behavioral questions, LeetCode, [take-homes]({% post_url 2021-11-22-CodingChallengeTips %}), IQ tests...Every company has a different answer.

But our "hiring is broken" posts won't change how big corporations interview. Decision-makers don't read coders' blogs.

Instead of venting into the void, why not share "here's what I learned and what I wish I had done differently..." posts, including:
* The kind of interview
* Subjects you forgot to review
* What you like and dislike about the process

Keep blogging. One day, [your blog becomes your portfolio]({% post_url 2025-01-12-BlogVsPortfolio %}), and interviews turn into discussions about your posts. That has happened to me only once.

Blogging won't fix hiring overnight. But it can fix how you stand out. That's why it's one of the lessons in [Street-Smart Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=hiring-broken-law), the roadmap I wish I had staring out.
