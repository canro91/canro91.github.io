I'm not an AI evangelist, and I'm not a hater either.

[I've tried AI for coding]({% post_url 2025-05-24-CodingWithAI %}). And after a week or two, I noticed [how dependent I was becoming]({% post_url 2025-07-13-TheProblemWithAI %}). Since then, I've used AI for small coding tasks, like generating small functions or finding typos, not to treat English as my main programming language.

Marcus Hutchins, a security researches, puts it boldly in his post [Every Reason Why I Hate AI and You Should Too](https://malwaretech.com/2025/08/every-reason-why-i-hate-ai.html):

> _I'd make a strong argument that what you shouldn't be doing is "learning" to do everything with AI. What you should be doing is learning regular skills. Being a domain expert prompting an LLM badly is going to give you infinitely better results than a layperson with a "Worldâ€™s Best Prompt Engineer" mug._

I agree with the core message. When everybody is relying on AI, it's time to go back to old-school habits:

* Read code
* Write trustworthy tests
* Devour classic textbooks
* Troubleshoot bugs with pen and paper

And outside coding: read books on paper, take notes by hand, and write our own summaries. To develop taste and judgment.

[Using AI is like holding a calculator]({% post_url 2025-03-31-AIAndCalculators %}) on a math exam. Even the best calculator is useless if you don't know what to compute, it's pretty much useless. Build skills, then leverage AI.

I used to think coding was only about cracking symbols. That's where AI shines. But coding is also about talking to non-tech managers, negotiating deadlines, and saying no politely.

And that's why I wrote, _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding_, to share the skills I wish I'd learned to become a confident coder.

[Get your copy of Street-Smart Coding here](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding). It's the roadmap I wish I had when I was starting out.
