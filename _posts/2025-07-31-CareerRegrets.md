My corporate journey didn't come with an instruction manual.

[I landed my first job]({% post_url 2024-09-02-LessonsFromMyFirstCodingJob %}) because that's what everyone does and what I was supposed to do. I joined the corporate world without any goal, other than "gain experience." Which I did it.

But [I was fired from my first job]({% post_url 2025-01-14-BeingFired %}), got bored from my second, and [got laid off]({% post_url 2024-12-05-HowALayoffFeels %}) from my last one. No survival kit or instruction manual. Only trial and error.

If I could start all over again, here are 10 actions I will never regret doing:

1. Change jobs often
2. Learn new skills constantly
3. Set a career goal or intention
4. Practice hobbies outside work
5. [Build a strong online presence earlier]({% post_url 2025-06-10-StartingFromZero %})
6. Invest in coaching, mentoring, and education
7. Learn a second or third language
8. Build multiple income sources
9. Grow a professional network
10. Have an emergency fund

And more importantly, figure out my own career and plan life instead of accepting the default path. [That's a lesson that took me 10 years to learn]({% post_url 2025-05-07-LifeLesson %}).
