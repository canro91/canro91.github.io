I ran my first Advent challenge in 2022.

Instead of an Advent of Code, I ran [an Advent of Posts]({% post_url 2022-12-01-AdventOfCode2022 %}). I wrote 22 posts, mostly about coding, in the days before Christmas. I missed two days but I declared the mission complete.

This year, I decided to follow the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). For the first time, this year included only 12 puzzles instead of 25.

I challenged myself to write "functionalish" solutions. Sometimes that was a bad idea.

## It wasn't a bunch of LeetCode problems

The puzzles weren't disconnected problems.

Every day started with a short story. The first day we arrived at the North Pole. Right away, we faced a setback that made us solve a puzzle. As we got inside the North Pole, there was always a complication.

In spite of the problems, elves were always organized. By the time we helped, they already had sorted out some details. That was our puzzle input. I guess elves are lazy or simply distracted.

There was a connecting story from one day to the next.

## It wasn't funny some days

My goal going through the challenge was to ignite my coding spark.

But some puzzles had ambiguous instructions or I overcomplicated the solution trying to follow a functional approach. I got stuck solving [Day 8]({% post_url 2025-12-14-AoC8 %}) and [Day 11]({% post_url 2025-12-17-AoC11 %}). I had to look up clues to get them done. Arrggg!

Those days, I got stuck with [a stupid Blazor issue]({% post_url 2025-11-18-BlazorValidation %}) at work. Getting stuck after work wasn't pleasant at all. The challenge was supposed to be funny and enjoyable. I didn't need another source of stress.

## My solutions

Despite the tough days, I eventually solved them all. OK, I cheated a bit.

Here are my solutions:

* Day 1: [Unlocking the North Pole]({% post_url 2025-12-02-AoC1 %})
* Day 2: [Finding Invalid Product IDs]({% post_url 2025-12-03-AoC2 %})
* Day 3: [Calculating the Joltage of Batteries]({% post_url 2025-12-04-AoC3 %})
* Day 4: [Counting Rolls of Paper]({% post_url 2025-12-07-AoC4 %})
* Day 5: [Counting Fresh Ingredients]({% post_url 2025-12-10-AoC5 %})
* Day 6: [Doing Cephalopods' Math]({% post_url 2025-12-11-AoC6 %})
* Day 7: [Splitting Tachyon Beams]({% post_url 2025-12-13-AoC7 %})
* Day 8: [Connecting Junction Boxes]({% post_url 2025-12-14-AoC8 %})
* Day 9: [Finding the Largest Rectangle of Red Tiles]({% post_url 2025-12-15-Aoc9 %})
* Day 10: [Initializing Factory Machines]({% post_url 2025-12-16-AoC10 %})
* Day 11: [Connecting the Reactor With a Server Rack]({% post_url 2025-12-17-AoC11 %})
* Day 12: [Packaging Presents]({% post_url 2025-12-18-AoC12 %})

From all the puzzles, one stood out. Day 12. It was playing Tetris with presents. My first thought was brute force with backtracking. After struggling with Day 11, I knew there was a simple alternative. And my intuition paid off.

## Biggest lessons

Apart from collecting more extension methods, here are the biggest lessons I took away:

1. Always strive for simple, stupid solutions.
2. LINQ can take you a long way. I solved almost all the puzzles using LINQ.
3. Review data structures. Once more, [I was trolled by trees]({% post_url 2024-05-27-ApplyingToFaang %}).

See you next year for another Advent of Code or maybe another Advent of Posts.

Advent of Code really sharpens your problem-solving skills. But coding isn't just about puzzles. It's also about teamwork, collaboration, and many skills I share in my book, _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding_. That's the roadmap I wish I'd known from day one to become a senior coder.
