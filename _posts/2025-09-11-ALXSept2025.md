This week, I had the chance to share some of my career lessons with the [ALX Africa community](https://www.facesofalxse.com/).

I joined [Shehab Abdel-Salam](https://www.shehababdelsalam.com/) to share the mindset shifts needed to land a coding job for the first time.

Here's the recording of the session:

And here are 15 takeaways from the session:

## Career Growth

**#1. Identify your gray zones vs growth zones.** A gray zone is doing comfortable work. And a growth zone is doing work that stretches your skills. To grow your career, do the things that scare you. Comfort zones kill growth.

**#2. Forget the corporate ladder.** Hard work alone doesn't guarantee results. Instead of chasing the corporate ladder, define your own success metrics and climb your own ladder.

**#3. [Stand out at work]({% post_url 2025-02-26-StandOutAtWork %}) by doing the work nobody else wants to do.**

**#4. Be aware of cultural expectations when working remotely.** When working with American companies, I missed the chitchat and off-topic conversations before starting meetings.

**#5.** As a junior coder, **stand out by showing you're able to learn new subjects and follow instructions.**

**#6. Rely on your personal and professional network to look for your first job.** Shake hands online and offline and skip the hiring lines.

Over ten years ago, I didn't apply through a job portal to [land my first job]({% post_url 2024-09-02-LessonsFromMyFirstCodingJob %}). I knew someone who knew someone who made an introduction. Then when I left my first job, my ex-boss arranged an interview for me. That's the power of your network.

**#7. Listen to feedback, say thanks, and act on it.** Avoid the temptation of explaining and justifying your behavior.

## Writing

**#8. Writing online is one of the most rewarding skills for your career.** It improves your research and communication skills. For example, [my blog has opened many career opportunities]({% post_url 2025-01-12-BlogVsPortfolio %}).

**#9. Your writing and online presence can replace your portfolio.** Every time you finish a project (or move to another job or achieve a milestone), write about the lessons you learned and what you would have done differently. And showcase those posts in [your LinkedIn profile]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}) or CV.

**#10.** If you're completely new to writing, [start with "Today I Learned" posts]({% post_url 2025-04-10-TilPosts %}). You don't need to write deep dives. Just document what you're learning. [That's exactly how I started writing]({% post_url 2023-07-18-FiveYearsOfBlogging %}).

## Technical Skills

**#11. Build simple apps and projects to practice.** Or even clone existing apps and some of their features.

**#12. Understand you don't need many programming languages to be a good coder.** You can make your way with HTML/CSS/Javascript, one backend language, and SQL.

**#13. Read engineering blogs:** [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/), [A Life Engineered](https://alifeengineered.substack.com/), [Shehab's blog](https://proactiveengineer.com/) and mine, of course.

**#14. Embrace the struggle. It's part of the learning process.** When you're stuck with a coding problem, don't rush to AI for a quick answer. Try solving it yourself and don't hesitate to ask for help.

**#15. Don't be scared of AI.** [Use it wisely](https://canro91.github.io/2025/03/24/NewCodersAndAI/). Otherwise, your coding muscles could atrophy.

If you're starting out, keep learning and having fun. [This is the best time to learn coding]({% post_url 2025-08-18-TooLateToLearnCoding %}). Always be a beginner.
