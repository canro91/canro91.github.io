title: "AI Is The Future And We, Coders, Have To Adapt"

AI is here to stay. We can't deny that.

One day, will AI become self-conscious and try to exterminate us all? Who knows. That's another discussion.

But we, as coders, have to adapt, as we always have, and adopt AI.

Today, I had a conversation with a group of ex-coworkers. One of the members shared he was asked to finish almost an entire working app as part of a [take-home coding challenge]({% post_url 2021-11-22-CodingChallengeTips %}) for an interview process at a startup. He was given only 5 hours. We all agreed that 5 hours wasn't enough.

Someone else said he should have used AI. But he refused.

Maybe the intention behind that take-home challenge was to use AI and come up with a decent working prototype quickly. Who knows? Companies aren't that clear with their interview process. And hiring is broken.

But we can't refuse to use AI.

AI is here to make us more efficient. What used to take days, now it only takes hours or minutes. By pressing a button, we compile thousands of source files in just seconds. Refusing to use AI is like refusing to use calculators or spreadsheets for accounting. It's like refusing to travel by plane or drive a car.

In our fast-paced world, where efficiency and productivity are rewarded, AI is a game-changer.

We can't pretend to keep using punch cards and computers that fill an entire room. AI is the future. And we have to adapt. [Coding in 2034 will change]({% post_url 2024-04-29-2034Predictions %}). But, one thing is certain: we can't use AI to replace our thinking. We should be the pilots, and AI as our copilot.
