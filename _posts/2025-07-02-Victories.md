Writing isn't hard. It's doing it when nobody is reading.

I started [reviving my LinkedIn account]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}) last year. At first, I only got one or two reactions from friends and ex-coworkers.

To keep myself showing up day after day, I started a "wins" folder. That's an idea I got from "Steal Like an Artist." Every time something good happens, like an encouraging comment or extra likes, I'd screenshot it for motivation.

This last week, I added another screenshot to it. It was a comment on my reposted Medium post about [writing a book for our future grandkids]({% post_url 2025-04-22-BookForGrandkids %}):

> _"I never thought of writing as a gift for future generations, but now I want to document everything. This really shifted something in me!"_

That comment made my day. I managed	to change a stranger's view on something with my words. And that was more rewarding than any of the other comments I had received recently.

Collect and celebrate your small victories, too. They make your day and keep you going.
