1. Writing is free therapy.
2. Detach your sense of meaning from your work.
3. You don't need to find a "passion" to succeed.
4. Working on your health brings clarity to your life.
5. You are not your job title. You're way more than that.
6. Do what you can control and let go of everything else.
7. Stop chasing a fancy title. Optimize for a lifestyle instead.
8. Any change in your life starts in your mind with your beliefs.
9. Build multiple income sources right now. Your life depends on it.
10. Start and double down on what works. There won't be a perfect time to start.
11. Eat to have more energy and think better. You are what you put in your body.
12. The right daily routine and habits can change your life. The wrong ones can destroy it.
13. Your health and well-being are more important than a job. You can always find a new job. But a new body? Not that easy!

If there's one habit I'm sticking to in 2025, it is taking care of my body, mind, and spirit every single day.
