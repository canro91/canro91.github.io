If you’re afraid of selling, you won’t get a dime.

But to sell with your content, you don’t have to resort to banners, invasive popups, and countdown timers to trick people into buying.

From [Mark Thompson](https://medium.com/@seriousmarketersonly), a veteran marketer I followed on Medium, I learned [the Article Funnel method](https://simpleisprofit.com/article-funnel-challenge) to turn every post into a sales funnel. 

Here are my takeaways from his method and from following him:

**#1. Promote something in every post.** That’s what Mark does in every post. At the end of his posts, there’s a CTA to a related offer.

I stopped being afraid of promoting anything in every post when I learned that’s the method [famous creators use to make millions online]({% post_url 2025-06-01-DanKoe %}).

**#2. Give away something valuable in the post.** It’s so annoying when you open a post titled “10 ways/tips/lessons to…” and when you open it, you only find one or two items and you have to buy something to access the rest. That’s how you lose readers.

Don’t be afraid of giving something. That makes you the source of answers. And we always go back to the one who helps us.

**#3. Use a natural transition to introduce your offer.** I used to put a divider at the end of my post before adding my CTAs. They felt like an appendix, most people ignored.

Instead, the Article Funnel suggests to naturally introduce your offer with a transition paragraph, without sounding salesy or desperate. Something as simple as “if this resonates with you, you’re going to like…where I …”

No tactics or tricks, just helpful content that points to a related offer. That makes your content into a sales representative working 24/7. And that’s the method I’m using from now on to promote my own products.
