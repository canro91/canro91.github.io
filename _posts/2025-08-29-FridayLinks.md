Hey, there.

I had a really busy, long, and heart-breaking week. I only could curate 3 links for you this week. Here they are.

#1. Often, the hardest feeling for a writer is sitting in front of a blank page. That's what we know as writers' block. But what about [developers' block](https://underlap.org/developers-block/) (8min).

#2. Here's a breakdown of [how databases actually store data](https://www.deepintodev.com/blog/how-databases-store-your-tables-on-disk) (16min).

#3. Most of our time as backed coders is writing RESTful API, here's [how to do it](https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-api-design/) (21min)
