We can't compete with AI on speed.

AI is getting faster, better, stronger, and cheaper. In seconds, it can produce a post about almost any topic in any writing style. An essay about climate change in the style of Hemingway? AI spits it out. Beep, beep, boop!

[The battle against AI-generated content is lost]({% post_url 2025-02-15-FightingAIContent %}).

## Even if one day AI writes better and faster, I'll still write because:

1. **Writing is learning**: If you want to check if you understand a subject, try writing about it.
2. **Writing is teaching**: You don't need a lecture hall to teach or share anything. Simply write about it somewhere on the internet. 
3. **Writing brings clear thinking**: This reason is strong enough not to outsource our writing to AI.
4. **Writing is building a time capsule**: Writing is leaving breadcrumbs of what we were learning and doing. It's leaving success clues. It's [a time capsule]({% post_url 2020-07-20-TimeCapsule %}).
5. **Writing is free, public therapy**: In 2024, [I applied to FAANG and failed]({% post_url 2024-05-27-ApplyingToFaang %}). Instead of ranting that hiring is broken, I decided to write about it. It was liberating.
6. **Writing is an exercise for my creative mind**: After [ditching my to-do lists]({% post_url 2025-01-11-DitchingTodos %}), writing is part of my daily routine to do something for my body, mind, and spirit each day.

## And more importantly, writing helped me recover from burnout last year.

Last year, I took officially [my first writing class]({% post_url 2024-12-26-WriteDaily %}).

It was the first step toward taking my writing seriously after about [five years of blogging]({% post_url 2023-07-18-FiveYearsOfBlogging %}). Writing daily was part of welcoming a sense of joy into my life after all the dissatisfaction and disengagement of burning out.

In the end, writing rescued me.

Even if AI splits the world into [writers and write-nots]({% post_url 2024-11-24-WriteNots %}), even if it spits words faster than I ever could, I'll continue writing, for my health, for my joy, for myself. I'd like to be a writer.
