Hey there.

Do you remember the first time you saw a computer? I do. And I originally wrote [that story on my blog]({% post_url 2025-04-15-FirstTimeISawAComputer %}) (2min). But this week, it went kind of "viral" when I reposted it on dev.to.

Anyway, here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. AI can make us code faster. But [writing code has never been the bottleneck](https://ordep.dev/posts/writing-code-was-never-the-bottleneck) (3min). It's everything around writing that code in the first place.

#2. Curious about the backstory of some coding jargon? Here's [why we "call" functions](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2025/04/04/etymology-of-call/) (10min). Funny enough, we also say "invoke" a function and in Spanish, everyone associates "invoking" with ghosts.

#3. Instead of forcing devs to use AI, here are [some ideas for managers to adopt AI](https://newsletter.manager.dev/p/stop-forcing-ai-tools-on-your-engineers) (7min) in their teams.

#4. Also an introvert? Here's [a quick guide to networking](https://aginfer.bearblog.dev/how-to-network-as-an-introvert/) (5min) for you. Not the networking type with cables and switches.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the "I just went on vacation" effect]({% post_url 2025-07-09-GoingOnVacation %}) (2min) and [4 lessons to start your first online business]({% post_url 2025-07-06-SmallBets %}) (3min).
