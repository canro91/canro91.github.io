title: "The Real #1 Sign You've Become a Senior Software Engineer"

I'm not exactly sure when "Senior" made its way into my title.

In my last full-time job, I was "Software Engineer 1" out of 5. But I worked on the main features of the software, was in the on-call rotation, and sat in meetings with the company's president. A "SWE 1" wasn't supposed to be doing most of those tasks.

OK, that was at a small shop in my city, so maybe it wasn't that impressive. And it took me about 5 years and [a lot of hard work]({% post_url 2025-02-26-StandOutAtWork %}) to get there.

Although "Senior" wasn't officially part of my title, there was [a sign I saw in my coworkers and mentors]({% post_url 2022-12-18-LessonsFromExCoworkers %}), and later connecting the dots, I noticed I had absorbed from them:

Knowing when to stop because a solution is good enough.

As non-seniors, we keep wasting time:
* Adding abstractions,
* Micro-optimizing infrequently-used code,
* [Debating variable names during code reviews]({% post_url 2022-12-05-LeadingQuestionsOnCodeReviews %}),
* Starting [massive unrequested refactorings]({% post_url 2023-09-04-AgainstMassiveUnrequestedRefactorings %}), and
* [Overengineering our app to make it scale]({% post_url 2025-05-17-NeedForScale %}).

You're senior when you truly master YAGNI, not only in your code files, but across your entire career.
