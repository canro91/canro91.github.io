Last week, I shared [lessons I learned from a team's architect]({% post_url 2025-10-25-LessonsFromMentor %}).

He taught me to simplify complex coding problems into one line. A skill that has become easier with experience.

The same principle applies to any creative work.

But I completely forgot about it when writing and launching [Street-Smart Coding]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}), my latest book.

Movies, novels, and TV shows summarize their plot into a line or short paragraph for posters or synopses.

With a one-liner, writing promotional material is easier. "A vampire romance for teenagers."

Next time you create something, describe it in a single line. You might need it on your sales pages or simply when someone asks you "what's your new project about?" With a one-liner, you'll always have a simple, confident answer.
