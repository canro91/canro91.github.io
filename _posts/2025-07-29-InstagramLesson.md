We all know doom-scrolling is the worst.

But recently, I found myself doing precisely that on Instagram. Not every day has to [be productive]({% post_url 2025-07-16-ProductivityTips %}), right?

Out of hundreds of posts, one made me stop scrolling.

It was the video of a girl cleaning a house while saying she wanted to keep cleaning houses for a living, even with two graduate degrees. It was probably a sketch promoting a book.

But she said a line that resonated deeply with me:

> _"I don't want to pretend I care about things I don't care about."_

Wow! That made my head explode. That was me a couple of years ago, stuck in a 9-5 with decent pay and flexible hours, pretending to care. Spoiler alert: [I got sick and burned out]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}). I didn't burn out by doing too much, but from boredom and indifference. By doing things I didn't care about.

And that line made the scrolling session worth it. Yes, even doom-scrolling can teach valuable lessons life lessons.
