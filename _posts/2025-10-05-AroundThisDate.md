My blog is my time capsule. Today, I opened it to find out what I was into. Here's what I found.

In 2020, exactly on this date, I wrote about [comparing dates without the time part in SQL Server]({% post_url 2020-10-05-CompareDateTimeSQLServer%}). At that time, I was learning SQL Server performance tuning with [Brent Ozar's courses]({% post_url 2022-05-02-BrentOzarMasteringCoursesReview %}) and his writing style inspired most of my SQL posts.

In 2022, I was contracting with an American client and we were trying to implement DDD in their new projects. I shared my notes on the book [Hands-on Domain-Driven Design with .NET Core]({% post_url 2022-10-03-HandsOnDDDTakeaways %}).

And in 2023, I was already [compiling four interested links about coding]({% post_url 2023-10-02-MondayLinks%}) every Monday. That was the seed to later start [Friday Links](https://fridaylinks.beehiiv.com/subscribe).

At that time, I was playing the SEO game. I can notice it: I wrote question/answer posts with a bolded paragraph answering the post question. I was hoping to win the target answers on Google search results. Since then, I moved away from the SEO game and [changed my blogging strategy]({% post_url 2025-01-27-TimesOfDeadBlogging %}).
