You know that saying, "Don't give advice unless asked?"

Well, some people ignored it and gave it anyway. Here are the best pieces of advice I've received:

## From high school:

> _"Read, because if you don't read, you won't learn anything."_

That was from my philosophy teacher in high school. He said it all the time. I don't remember much from his class, but for some reason that line has stayed with me.

If I still remember that years later, he did his job.

## From my first job:

> _"Imagine you make half of your salary, save the other half."_

A senior co-worker at [my first coding job]({% post_url 2024-09-02-LessonsFromMyFirstCodingJob %}) gave me that totally unexpectedly. That lesson stuck with me so much, I couldn't resist adding it to my [an email course](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/careerlessonsfromthetrenches) I created years later.

## From my last full-time job:

> _"Diversify your career."_

That was from [one of my not-mentors]({% post_url 2024-11-26-FindingMentors %}). I reached out to him when I wasn't sure about where to take [my software engineering career]({% post_url 2025-03-04-CareerLessonIWishIKnew %}). We had many 1-on-1s. That's what I remember the most. It was good advice. I didn't follow it. [I burned out]({% post_url 2025-03-22-IsBurnoutInevitable %}).
