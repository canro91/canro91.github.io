Hey!

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. A couple of years ago, I challenged myself to learn React. And being a backend developer, I missed the simplicity of the old days: Just some logic inside the script tag to bind forms. It turns out adopting [functional principles shaped and twisted the frontend ecosystem](https://alfy.blog/2025/10/04/how-functional-programming-shaped-modern-frontend.html) (20min). It has made us reinvent the wheel. Again.

#2. LLMs replacing human devs? Well, here are [two tasks LLMs are still bad at](https://kix.dev/two-things-llm-coding-agents-are-still-bad-at/) (2min). Maybe they're more like "weird, overconfident interns."

#3. It's never 5 minutes... when you snooze your alarm, when your manager asks you a quick favor, or when you think you can stretch hours of work right before clocking out. Here's a [productivity tip](https://alikhil.dev/posts/the-simple-habit-that-saves-my-evenings/) (4min) to avoid that "5 minutes" turning into working extra hours.

#4. For nostalgia or history, here's [how the Internet looked in 2000](https://cybercultural.com/p/internet-2000/) (8min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [how to keep creating when it feels pointless]({% post_url 2025-10-08-PastSelf %}) (1min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by...

I'm currently putting the final polish on my book, _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding."_ While I finish up, you can [preorder your digital copy](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding) and read a preview featuring 5 of the 30 tips, just to get you started.

See you next time,

Cesar
