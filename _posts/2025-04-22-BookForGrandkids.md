The definition of book has changed.

The other day, while reading James Altucher's archive, I learned a book doesn't have to be a 10,000-word New York Times bestseller, traditionally published.

A book could be a 20-page personal story or [a summary of 10 scientific papers]({% post_url 2024-12-27-WritingABook %}). And you don't have to write it for the masses.

A book could simply be a story for our grandkids.

It doesn't matter if it doesn't sell thousands of copies or get 5-star reviews or get featured in newspapers. The real audience of our book is 4 or 5 people, our future relatives.

It would be great to read how grandpa found his first job, met grandma, and made it through life. I wish I had a firsthand glimpse of their lives.

You don't need 10,000 words or a traditional publisher. You just need a story to tell. And chances are you already have one.
