Don't write to attract recruiters or create a brand. 

Sure. Those are benefits of writing online. When we write online, good and unexpected things happen.

By writing online, we gain followers, build a brand, attract opportunities, and skip hiring lines.

By luck or accident, I made my first internet money writing, because I showed some of my posts.

But the real reason to write online is:

**Clear thinking.**

Write to think clearly. Write to formulate your ideas coherently, with no fluff.

Before you write, you have to put your thoughts in order. You need a message. You need structure. You need a reader persona.

That's more valuable than recruiters knocking at your door with "life-changing opportunities for well-known companies in the tech sector."

Writing is the most valuable and transferable skill you can learn.
