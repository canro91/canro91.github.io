No headline, no readers. As simple as that.

A headline is your welcome sign. If you don't have a good one, readers won't stop by. And no matter how thoughtful the content is, a weak headline means they won't click or read past the first line.

And the best way to learn how to write headlines? Steal from the best. Just like artists do.

## Stealing some proven headline examples

I had already stolen [headlines from a famous YouTuber]({% post_url 2024-12-17-BetterHeadlines %}).

But this time, I'm stealing [Derek Hughes' headlines](https://derekhughes1.medium.com/), a top Medium writer with over 20,000 followers.

Here are the headlines of some of his most liked posts:

* 5 ways to gain an unfair advantage as a writer (no one tells you about)
* How to escape the life you have (the simplest habit that changed everything)
* How to write an article in 5 easy steps (that anyone can follow)
* This is why you're losing readers (3 ways to keep them hooked)
* 4 killer openers that will hook your readers in seconds

Those headlines are irresistible. But there's something behind them.

## The secret formula behind irresistible headlines

Each follows a simple formula:

Promise + outcome + emotion (curiosity/fear/desire)

Let's dissect them:

* 5 ways to gain an unfair advantage as a writer (no one tells you about)
	* Promise: "5 ways"
	* Outcome: "gain an unfair advantage"
	* Curiosity: "no one tells you about"
* How to escape the life you have (the simplest habit that changed everything)
	* Promise: "the simplest habit"
	* Outcome: "escape the life you hate"
	* Curiosity: "changed everything"

You get the point.

It's not a surprise why [some of my best headlines]({% post_url 2025-04-26-MyMostReadHeadlines %}) worked. They promised some value with a bit of curiosity.

You only have a few seconds to hook readers. Start with a clear promise and outcome in your headlines. Don't scare readers away with [boring opening lines]({% post_url 2025-06-04-OpeningLines %}). Make your headlines impossible to ignore.
