A big project might seem daunting. Too many tasks, too many possible outcomes, and the fear of failure.

If you want to write a book, you might ask: What if nobody buys it? What if nobody reads it? What if it only gets bad reviews?

When stuck, answer: What's the worst thing that could happen?

After identifying that "worst thing," we realize all this uncertainty and fear was just noise in our heads. And that worst thing wasn't that bad after all.

If nobody buys or reads your book, you still learned to outline a book, tell stories, choose a cover, buy an ISBN, and upload it to Amazon. The worst thing wasn't that bad after all. You were only drowning in a glass of water. And you see how small your fear really was.
