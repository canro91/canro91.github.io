title: "AI Means You Don't Need to Learn So Many Programming Languages"

We no longer need to keep learning new programming languages.

If AI writes 90% of our code, becoming a polyglot coder isn't valuable anymore.

Here's what Gergely Orosz says in [When AI Writes All Code](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what),

> _...With AI writing most of the code, the advantage of knowing several languages will become less important when any engineer can jump into any codebase and ask the AI to implement a feature – which it will probably take a decent stab at. Even better, you can ask AI to explain parts of the codebase and quickly pick up a language much faster than without AI tools._

Obsessing over learning languages didn't work for me. That was before AI.

Trying to master many languages was [my biggest mistake as a new coder]({% post_url 2025-10-21-BiggestMistake %}). Something else always made [people stand out]({% post_url 2026-01-04-CodeCantSpeak %}). And something else [got me into trouble]({% post_url 2025-01-14-BeingFired %}).

The real question is what skills matter.

Maybe AI is making us:
* Master one general-purpose language, like C or Go.
* Understand core principles: problem decomposition, clean code, and SOLID.
* Develop strong [code-reading skills]({% post_url 2025-03-26-ReadCode %})

Or maybe we should learn languages that challenge our thinking: Haskell, LISP, or a language from a different paradigm. Learning Java after C# doesn't teach much. AI can generate code in "challenging" languages, but they build [stronger problem-solving skills]({% post_url 2025-10-27-ProblemSolving %}) for prompting LLMs.

To stand out when AI shines at coding, we need to step beyond the IDE. We need teamwork, communication, and the broader skills I cover in [Street-Smart Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ai-means-you-dont-need-learn-many-programming-languages). It's the roadmap I wish I had when starting out.
