Guaranteed results in 10 simple steps:

1. **Ignore ideas and suggestions.** If anyone comes with an idea or suggestion, ignore it. And if anyone raises a concern, say it's fine and it used to be worse.

2. **Take credit for someone else's idea.** If anyone comes with an idea and you don't want to ignore it, say "oh, that was what I told you we should do."

3. **Don't share any vision or project goals.** Just keep your team closing JIRA tickets. Tickets and more tickets.

4. **When someone asks for a salary review, say "come back in a few months."** And then, tell them to come back again. And on and on.

5. Once a task or project is finished, **publicly praise someone else's work.**

6. **Give your team boring and repetitive work.** The more boring and repetitive, the better. Make them dig holes. Then make them fill those holes.

7. **Make them work on projects no one will use.** Did your team work on a project for six months? Archive it, deprioritize it, or make sure nobody uses it.

8. Your team worked hard, but why share what the users think? That's not their business, right? **Don't share any feedback.** Just keep them finishing tickets. See #3.

9. **Use the word "resource" to refer to them and treat them accordingly.** Your team members are machines you can replace anytime.

10. **Lay off people and tell the ones who stay "nothing is happening."** And if they ask about it, tell them they should be grateful for still having a job.

Follow these steps and you'll have team members who will leave you at their first chance.
