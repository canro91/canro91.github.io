If you don't come up with your own plan, society, the system, or the Matrix will give you its plan:
* Work hard
* Get 3% raises
* Please your bosses
* Keep your head down
* Wait to retire
* Then, die

I only learned it after [being laid off]({% post_url 2024-12-05-HowALayoffFeels %}) and [recovering from burnout]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}) and stomach problems. That was my wake-up call.

I was living on autopilot. No plan at all. Stretching each job until I got bored, fired, or laid off. I was working on building somebody else's dream.

I wish I had learned this lesson at 25, but at least I know it now.
