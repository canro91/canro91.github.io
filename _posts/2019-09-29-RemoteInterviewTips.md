Are you applying for a remote position? Or for a on-site position but the interviewer is on another branch outside your city? Are preparing yourself for future interviews? These tips are for you. Read on!

## Interview types

There are four types of interviews you can find while applying for a new job.

1. **Conversation**: The interviewer will start a casual conversation about your experience, your past positions and your skills. Be ready to describe one or two past projects. Make sure to include:
	* Name of the project
	* Purpose and Market
	* Duration: How long did it take to finish it? or how long were you in it?
	* Tech Stack: what frameworks and tools did you use on the front-end and the back-end?
	* Team Size: Did you have a QA team? designers?
	* Role and areas in charge: What did you do inside the project? What were you responsible for?
	* Biggest challenge you faced in the project: a new tech stack? changing requirements? short duration?
2. **Interrogation**: The interviewer will have a list of predefined questions to test your knowledge on the skills required for the position. Be ready to answer questions of the type:
	* what's the difference between a class and an object?
	* what's the difference between inheritance and polymorphism?
	* state and explain 3 GangOfFour design patterns
	* state and explain the SOLID principles
	* [what's the difference between Func and Action?]({% post_url 2019-03-22-WhatTheFuncAction %})

4. **Homework**: The interviewer will ask you to solve a medium-size exercise in a couple of hours or even days. *Make sure you follow best practices and code as clean as possible! It's time to show off your coding skills*

## Before, during and after

Now you know the interview types, it's time to move on to the interview preparation.

1. **Check the date and time**. Make sure you have the time in your own timezone
2. **Install and setup the software needed**. Is it Skype, Zoom or Hangouts? Did you receive an invitation link?
3. **Do not answer the videocall using your cellphone**. *Do you remember the type of interviews?* It isn't that comfortable to solve an exercise using the phone
4. **Use video only if the interviewer uses it**
5. **Reduce background noise**. Do not answer the videocall from a cafe, a shopping mall or a public hotspot. If  your are staying at home, ask the people around you not to disturb you while in the interview. 
6. **Show up 10 minutes earlier**
7. **Be ready to introduce yourself using an elevator pitch**. You will have less than 30 seconds to say who you are and what you have done professionally. Make sure to include in your pitch:
    * Years of experience
    * Education
    * Type of projects you have worked with: banking, marketing, etc
    * Specialty: fullstack, backend, fronted, mobile, etc
    * Languages, frameworks and tools you know
    * A hobby
9. **Be precise**. Answer within 60 seconds
10. **Summarize all your skills and strengths**, before finishing the meeting

## Final tips

Now, you know the type of interviews you will find. Be prepared for them! Practice your elevator pitch and your project descriptions. Have a printed copy of them next to you during the interview, in case of panic attack. Be enthusiast and precise. Happy interviewing!
