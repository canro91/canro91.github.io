Are you applying for a remote position? Or for a on-site position but the interviewer is on another branch outside your city? Are preparing yourself for future interviews? These tips are for you. Read on!

## Interview types

Know the diferent types of interviews and prepare for them.

There are four types of interviews you can find while applying for a new job.

### 1. Conversation

The interviewer will start a casual conversation about your experience, your past positions and your skills. Be ready to describe one or two past projects. When describing your projects, make sure to include:

* Name of the project
* Purpose and Market
* Duration: How long did it take to finish it? or how long were you in it?
* Tech Stack: what frameworks and tools did you use on the front-end and the back-end?
* Team Size: Did you have a QA team? designers?
* Role and areas in charge: What did you do inside the project? What were you responsible for?
* Biggest challenge you faced in the project: a new tech stack? changing requirements? short duration?

### 2. Interrogation

The interviewer will have a list of predefined questions to test your knowledge on the skills required for the position. Be ready to answer questions of the type:

* what's the difference between a class and an object?
* what's the difference between inheritance and polymorphism?
* state and explain 3 GangOfFour design patterns
* state and explain the SOLID principles
* [what's the difference between Func and Action?]({% post_url 2019-03-22-WhatTheFuncAction %})
* what's the difference between LINQ and extension methods?
* what's the difference between `async` and `await`?

### 3. Programming exercise

### 4. Homework

The interviewer will ask you to solve a medium-size exercise in a couple of hours or even days.

Use Git and write good commit messages. Follow best practices and code as clean as possible! It's time to show off your coding skills.

Dont' forget to add a README file to your solution. Include features you implemented, libraries you used, major design decisions you made and how to install your solution.

## Before, during and after

Now you know the interview types, it's time to move on to the interview preparation.

1. **Check the date and time**. Make sure you have the time in your own timezone
2. **Install and setup the software needed**. Is it Skype, Zoom or Hangouts? Did you receive an invitation link? Do you need a password to use the link?
3. **Do not answer the videocall using your cellphone**. *Do you remember the type of interviews?* It isn't that comfortable to solve an exercise using the phone
4. **Use video only if the interviewer uses it**
5. **Reduce background noise**. Do not answer the videocall from a cafe, a shopping mall or a public hotspot. If  your are staying at home, ask the people around you not to disturb you while in the interview. 
6. **Show up 10 minutes earlier**
7. **Be ready to introduce yourself using an elevator pitch**. You will have less than 30 seconds to say who you are and what you have done professionally. Make sure to include in your pitch:
    * Years of experience
    * Education
    * Type of projects you have worked with: banking, marketing, etc
    * Specialty: fullstack, backend, fronted, mobile, etc
    * Languages, frameworks and tools you know
    * A hobby
9. **Be precise**. Answer within 60 seconds
10. **Summarize all your skills and strengths**, before finishing the meeting

## Final tips

Voila! Now, you know the type of interviews you will find. Be prepared for them! Practice your elevator pitch and your project descriptions. Have a printed copy of them next to you during the interview, in case of panic attack. Be enthusiast and precise.
