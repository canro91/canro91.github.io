Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. Here's [how to sell yourself](https://www.fldr.zip/blog/sell-yourself) (3min). It distills the tactics from the guy who landed and balanced multiple startup jobs at the same time. He must have done something right to land those jobs in the first place, right?

#2. Want to build software quickly? Here's [a guide on how to do it](https://evanhahn.com/how-i-build-software-quickly/) (12min).

#3. When I hear "ergonomic," I think of chairs or keyboards. But what about repositories? Here's [how to make repos ergonomic too](https://pdx.su/blog/2025-07-10-make-your-repo-ergonomic/) (14min). It starts with the README file.

#4. Like human languages, programming languages grow, evolve, and die. They borrow features from one another. Here are some of the [already dead but influential programming languages](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/influential-dead-languages/) (20min). I used one of those in high school.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [two tiny fixes to improve your communication at work]({% post_url 2025-07-14-CommAtWork %}) (2min) and [10 pieces of tech we use before breakfast without noticing them]({% post_url 2025-07-17-TechBeforeBreakfast %}) (3min).
