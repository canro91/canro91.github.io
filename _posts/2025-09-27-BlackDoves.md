title: "Six Clever Writing Tricks in Netflix's Black Doves"

I binge-watched another TV show again. And to not feel guilty, I'm writing about it.

This time, I watched [Black Doves](https://www.netflix.com/co-en/title/81682935) on Netflix, an espionage and action story that takes place in present-day London. The Black Doves, a private intelligence firm, placed an agent close to a top government official to steal secrets and sell them.

## After binge-watching the 6 episodes, here are the writing devices I noticed:

**#1. It starts with action, blood, and mystery.** The first scene shows a triple killing. Enough action to hook anyone.

**#2. Every episode complicates the plot more.** It felt like watching _The Mandalorian_, where each alliance pulls Mando away from his goal. The same thing happens in this show.

A simple revenge turns into an entangled plot that involves Britain's political stability and possibly sparks the next World War.

**#3. Almost every episode starts with a time jump** to show us the background story of our characters. We see how Helen is recruited and how she turns from an amateur agent into a cold-blooded killer with a double life.

**#4. It uses flashbacks to tell us when Helen is lying.** The Black Doves have one rule they take seriously: nobody should know about the existence of the organization. But Helen broke this rule and she lies about it all the time. And through flashbacks, we see the truth.

**#5. Instead of an omniscient narrator, we get to know about Helen's past through an interview.** She applies to an international company, where her past is questioned during the interview. We get to know her without boring dialog or narration. Clever trick!

**#6. They use a line as a connecting element.** "If one door closes, a window opens elsewhere," or something like that. We hear it in almost every episode. It keeps the plot going in spite of every setback.
