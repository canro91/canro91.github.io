Hey there.

I just realized I already had 4 links and I didn't want to wait for next Friday to share them. So here they are.

These first two are just for laughs:

**#1.** Imagine waking up to an invoice for $0.01 from your cloud provider. Yep, that happened. [Here's the full story](https://linuxblog.io/digitalocean-1-cent-automation/) (10min).

**#2.** Now imagine sharing a name with the creator of a major social media platform. You won't believe how many emails you would receive [if your name were Mark Zuckerberg](https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/) (2min).

On a more thoughtful and serious note...

**#3.** Everybody blames AI for the recent layoffs, especially the ones at Amazon. But [there's a real reason](https://cool-as-heck.blog/on-amazon-layoffs-and-ai) (1min) and of course, nothing to do with AI.

**#4.** My best interview was just one call and one open source contribution. That happens rarely. But [what if open source contributions were like service duty?](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/practicing/contributing-to-opensource-should-be-required-like-jury-duty) (2min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the scariest lines of code I've written]({% post_url 2025-11-06-ScariestLine %}) (2min) and [my reactions to r/csharp homepage]({% post_url 2025-11-04-RoastingReddit %}) (4min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... Check my latest book, [Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=wednesday-links-layoffs-zuckerberg-emails). From Googling to clear communication, you'll find 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. It's the roadmap I wish I had moving from junior to senior and the one I hope helps you too.

See you next time,

Cesar
