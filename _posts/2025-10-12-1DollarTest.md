Yesterday, I shared [the Article Funnel method]({% post_url 2025-10-11-ContentThatSells %}), a simple strategy to write content that sells.

And to test your content-based business (and that method) works, you need to pass **the $1-dollar test.** That's another lesson from Mark Thompson, apart from the Article Funnel.

If what you write generates at least $1 in sales, you have a system that works. You already have posts with a compelling CTA that lead to a landing page for a product readers find valuable. It means you have [the right copy]({% post_url 2024-12-20-CopywritingStudyPlan %}) and the right setup.

With all that in place, from then on, you need to volume and consistency.
