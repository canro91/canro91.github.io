title: "Steal This Strategy: How to Work with Beta Readers to Launch Your Book"

I stole the process of working with beta readers. Borrow it, let's say.

I've been a technical editor for Manning, a publishing company that specializes in coding books. And after going through the process twice, I copy their process to work with beta readers for [my next coding book]({% post_url 2025-09-21-30Ways %}).

Here's what I did.

**#1. Have something decent to share.** Beta readers are the first eyeballs that read your draft. You don't need a polished or finished book, just a decent draft someone can read. It's OK if there are typos here and there. The goal isn't to line edit it, but to refine the overall book structure and content.

**#2. Create a list of 10 people that can help.** [I'm a fan of 10-idea lists]({% post_url 2025-06-17-TenIdeas %}), so that was an excuse to write another one.

I asked LinkedIn connections and friends for help. I used Google Docs to share the draft. Manning has a custom platform for that. I did it the DIY way.

I shared half of my draft (15 of the 30 chapters I had planned) with half of my beta readers, and the other half to the rest. I didn't want to overwhelm them with too many pages. They're busy and helping for free.

**#3. Offer something in return.** This is a strategy I copied from Manning. I offered a free digital copy, a mention in the Acknowledgments section, and a shout-out in a LinkedIn post on launching day. Well, Manning doesn't offer a shout out. I did.

**#4. Ask for specific feedback.** I asked them not to focus too much on typos or grammar issues.

Here's a list of questions I asked my beta readers to answer after their review.

* What did you like the most? What did you like the least?
* Any repetitive parts? Boring parts? Confusing parts?
* Any factual errors?
* Does the content deliver on the book promise?
* What can I do better? What should I include or remove?

I put those questions on page one of the Google Doc.

**#5. Share a deadline.** I forgot to tell my beta readers my launch date. Some of them gave feedback after a couple of days. Others never shared anything. I guess they were busy and I didn't set a deadline. My bad!

And here's the best piece of advice I've found: Listen to what beta readers say is wrong, but don't rely on them for how to fix it. That's your job as the writer.
