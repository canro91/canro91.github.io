Selling feels dirty to far too many people.

Maybe that's because we have the wrong impression of selling as tricking people into buying something they don't need with pushy lines or sales tactics. "I'm making an exception for you. Hurry up! If my boss finds out about this, I'm fired."

The truth is we're selling all the time, even without realizing it.

[Isra Bravo, the best copywriter of Spain]({% post_url 2025-01-16-SpainTopCopywriter %}), taught me that we've been selling since we're kids. We sell ourselves to get our parents' attention. And as adults, we continue selling: when looking for a job or for a romantic partner.

The other day, [a salesy DM made me change my perspective on selling]({% post_url 2024-11-01-SellingVsHelping %}): from pushy sales tactics to genuine help.

If we aren't ashamed of helping, we shouldn't be afraid of selling.

These days, jobs are uncertain and [layoffs are always around the corner]({% post_url 2024-12-05-HowALayoffFeels %}). Either you sell something (a book, course, template, coaching) and free yourself, or you sell 8 hours or more of your time and become a slave.

Remember, "whoever sits in a cubicle is replaceable." (Choose Yourself by [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %})) Sell something or sell your time forever.
