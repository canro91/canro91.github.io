Few things are more frustrating than going to the doctor.

It isn't just one visit. It's one visit, followed by some blood tests at a laboratory, then going back to the doctor with the results, then a visit to a specialist, then another round of tests, then another visit with test results... And regular checkups. Arrggg!

It's draining just thinking about it. That's why I've decided to adopt some healthy habits, like these:

**#1. Drink enough water to avoid kidney stones.** For so long, [I didn't care about my kidneys]({% post_url 2025-04-02-KidneysDoMatter %}) until I had to rush to the ER with a loved one. Diagnosis? Kidney failure.

**#2. Cut sugar to avoid diabetes.**

**#3. Exercise to keep the heart healthy.**

**#4. Get a good night's sleep.** It isn't that complicated. I leave my phone outside my room, turn off all lights, change my bedding often, and regulate the AC temperature.

**#5. Brush my teeth at least twice a day** and use dental floss once a day.

**#6. Sit less to avoid back pain.** This was something that started in my first job. I wasn't used to sitting for 8 hours on an uncomfortable chair. I had to change my chair at work and start walking. And more recently, I started to use a standing desk.

**#7. Eat vegetables with every meal** to go to the bathroom every day.

**#8. Place my computer near a window for natural light**, and put a lamp behind my display so it isn't the brightest source of light at night.

**#9. Cut processed food and sodas** to keep my blood pressure under control.

**#10. Have a daily moment of silence** to control stress.

**#11. Wear a good pair of shoes.** Again, back pain.

**#12. Eat more protein than carbs at every meal** to keep my weight under control. Not only eat more protein, but also reorder how you eat. Salads first, then proteins, and lastly carbs. Thanks to reordering how I eat, I feel more energetic throughout the day. And that's [my best productivity hack]({% post_url 2024-12-30-BestProductivityHack %}) since last year. 

**#13. Stay in contact with friends.** Just to be happier.

**#14. Take supplements for brain health.**

**#15. Don't drink alcohol** to protect the liver.

Maybe one day, [AI will transform our visits to hospitals and doctors]({% post_url 2025-04-20-MedAI %}). Who knows? But until then, I want to be healthy to avoid those long appointments.
