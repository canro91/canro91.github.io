title: "5 Reasons Why Listicles Rule Online (And Crush It on Social Media)"

**#1. They offer a clear promise.** "10 reasons" or "5 mistakes" are way better than "on writing" or "some thoughts on blogging." It's clear what to expect from the first two.

**#2. They are easy to digest and skim.** People don't read online. They skim. A listicle with bolded bullet points or subheaders is easier to skim than text-heavy essays. People can jump in at any point after skimming. And even if they only read those subheaders, they will take away some value from a listicle.

**#3. They follow a proven structure.** Listicles are popular because they work. The 10 Commandments, The 48 Laws of Power, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century are just three examples of listicles.

**#4. They offer more interaction points.** Every point invites comments and conversation. _"I really like point #n..."_

**#5. They offer more repurposing opportunities.** Listicle points with the most interaction make great standalone posts. See #4. That's one tip to [double our post count]({% post_url 2025-01-28-DoubleYourPostCount %}).

Best of all? If you already [write 10 ideas a day]({% post_url 2024-11-05-IdeaMachine %}), listicles practically write themselves.
