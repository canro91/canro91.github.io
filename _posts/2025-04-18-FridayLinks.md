Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. There's a difference between a program and a product. It's not the same hacking some lines for a one-time task as crafting an API for concurrent users. [Vibe coding shines at one of the two](https://dylanbeattie.net/2025/04/11/the-problem-with-vibe-coding.html) (3min).

#2. Google claims AI generates 20% of its code. But those claims make us [live in a post-developers era](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-post-developer-era/)? (12min). AI is like driving a car in cruise mode. It goes where you point it, but you still need your hands on the steering wheel.

#3. Here are [over 20 coding lessons](https://blog.rpanachi.com/after-25-years-writing-software-here-are-a-few-more-things-ive-learned-so-far-part2) (6min) from a coder with 25 years in the field. I had to learn the one about tracking request and responses the hard way.

#4. I'll keep my personal blog, even if blogging is dead. A blog is a place without rules to share anything you want. If you have something to say, [just put it on your blog](https://shellsharks.com/just-put-it-on-your-blog) (2min).

***

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about ["waking up experts" when specs aren't clear](https://canro91.github.io/2025/04/12/WakeUpTheExperts/) (2min) and [the first time I saw a computer](https://canro91.github.io/2025/04/15/FirstTimeISawAComputer/) (2min).

Here's this week's tip to get better at coding:

_Learn some sort of automated testing._

Call it unit, integration, TDD, BDD, or anything else. 

Chances are there are formal studies about the time required to maintain and fix bugs in codebases with unit tests compared to codebases without them.

But, empirically, the healthiest codebases I've worked with had unit tests.

Unit tests are a safety net when you're making changes. Your coding life will be better with unit tests than without them. And you'll miss unit tests when you work with a legacy application.

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by...Join my course, [C# NullReferenceException Demystified](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-nullreferenceexception-demystified/?referralCode=CC2A6F51EF27A75F1364) and in just 1 hour and 5 minutes, you'll learn the principles, features, and strategies to get rid of that exception.

See you next time,

Cesar
