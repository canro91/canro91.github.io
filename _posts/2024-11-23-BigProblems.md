That was what Seth Godin answered during [an interview with Jim Kwik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPiH5uGSVyo) for the Kwik Brain podcast. Jim asked him about mindset shifts for people stuck in the ideation phase, struggling to take action.

Then Seth expanded his answer by saying:

> _"Let's start with a small solution first...Let's figure out what's the smallest habit change that would lead you to create the conditions for the system to support you in where you're going."_

Seth used back pain as an example. Before going through back surgery, we should change shoes, lose weight, and walk. Those steps require 10 minutes a day. Less effort and commitment than surgery.

I connect that idea with [James Altucher's Daily Practice]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}). By doing something every day for our body, mind, and spirit, we're creating the conditions to support change in our lives.
