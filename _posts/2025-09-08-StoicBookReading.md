I've been binge-watching Ryan Holiday's Daily Stoic YouTube channel lately.

If you don't know about his work, he reads and writes books for a living. He wrote _The Obstacle is the Way_ and _Life of the Stoics_. And just the other day, I watched [his appearance on Joe Rogan's show]({% post_url 2025-09-07-JoeRogan %}).

After watching his videos with reading advice, here are 8 lessons I learned:

**#1. Read physical books.** That's an excuse to spend less time in front of screens.

**#2. Prefer old books.** Focus on books that have stood the test of time. If they have survived this long, they will survive a whole lot more.

**#3. Reread.** [I had to change my mind about rereading]({% post_url 2024-11-29-ReadingMore %}). I was against it when I tried to grow a large list of books I'd read. When we reread a book, our circumstances have changed. Every time we revisit a book, it's an opportunity to learn or notice new insights.

**#4. Have mentors to point you to more books.** If you can't find one, [find a not-mentor]({% post_url 2024-11-26-FindingMentors %}) instead.

**#5. "Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers."** That's a quote attributed to Harry Truman, one of the U.S. presidents.

**#6. Don't speed read.** To read faster, we need to read more. Simple as that.

**#7. Interact with the book you're reading.** Reading a book is like a conversation with the author. Highlight, fold corners, and take notes in the margins.

**#8. Use notecards for notes.** After a break, go back to the parts you highlighted or the pages you folded, and turn those interesting passages into notes. Ryan's note-taking system sounds like [Luhmann's Zettelkasten method]({% post_url 2020-11-18-HowToTakeSmartNotes %}).
