Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. With the raise of AI, we're in a [programming deflation](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/programming-deflation) (5min). "We're watching the basic economics of software development transform in real time."

#2. Typing isn't (and hasn't been) the bottleneck of coding. [AI is making us thinkers instead of typers](https://etsd.tech/posts/coders-end/) (4min).

#3. One of the things I hate about software engineering is estimation and story points. And guess what? [Story points answer nothing](https://failfastmoveon.blogspot.com/2025/09/story-points-answer-nothing.html) (4min).

#4. And here's [how someone hosted a website on a disposable vaper](https://bogdanthegeek.github.io/blog/projects/vapeserver/) (6min). Cool!

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the hardest lesson I learned migrating legacy code (again)]({% post_url 2025-09-18-LegacyMigration %}) (2min) and [the one rule junior coders should follow to adopt AI]({% post_url 2025-09-15-ShouldIUseAI %}) (1min).
