As full-time employees, we only stick to "our part."

If we're coders, we only care about coding. If we're designers, we only care about Photoshop. Somebody else handles finding clients, marketing, sales, and follow-ups. If we, as full-time employees, care about what's not "our part," [we stand out]({% post_url 2025-02-26-StandOutAtWork %}).

But with a side gig, a SaaS product, a novel, or a hobby to monetize, we have to also do everything else that isn't "our part."

When we do "our part," the job isn't done. We have to wear all those hats. We have to be our own marketing, sales, and customer satisfaction departments. We can't expect others to do that for us.

Doing great work alone isn't enough. People won't just come. Do great work, then make sure the world knows about it.
