title: "The Secret to a Sharp Mind from a 102-Year-Old Practicing Doctor"
tags: misc
---

Dr. Howard Tucker, at 102, still works as a neurologist. He holds the Guinness World Record for the world's oldest practicing doctor.

Of course, the first question that popped into my mind was "What's his secret?" I had to find out. That curiosity made me read [his Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw22v5/im_dr_howard_tucker_a_102yearold_neurologist/) and collect my favorite pieces of wisdom.

Here they are:

## "Consistency, curiosity, moderation, and a good sense of humor haven't failed me yet"

I wasn't the only one wondering about Dr. Tucker's secret to his sharp mind. That question came up more than once throughout the whole discussion.

It turns out there's no secret or magic formula. Just good habits practiced consistently over the long term.

> ... Never stop learning. I've always believed that the brain is like a muscle—if you don't use it, it atrophies. I went to law school at 67 for the mental stimulation and because law fascinates me. Not because I needed another job, but because I wanted to challenge myself. You don't need to necessarily pursue a degree—read, debate, and stay curious.
>
> Keep working, if you can. I firmly believe that retirement is the enemy of longevity. I'm not saying everyone should work into their hundreds, but purpose matters. I still work in the medical field because it gives me structure, meaning, and a reason to wake up early (though I am enjoying sleeping in more now.) ...

> Move your body. I walk every day on my treadmill. It's good for the brain and body, but hopefully you already knew that.
>
> The truth is that there's no secret sauce. I won't deny genetics playing a large role in longevity. Genetics is a good head start, but consistency, curiosity, moderation, and a good sense of humor haven't failed me yet.

This is a good reason to keep [following my Daily Practice]({% post_url 2025-01-11-DitchingTodos %}): doing something for my body, mind, and spirit every day. Since last year, it's been the one habit I'm following religiously. Maybe I'll make it to 102 if I stick with it.

## "[Your job] doesn't define who you are. Let your curiosity and how you treat others define who you are as a person"

A young medical intern asked for his advice on work-life balance during residency, and here's what Dr. Tucker said:

> The key is to have at least one thing outside of medicine that is just yours, and you must commit to making time for it even if it's just 15-30 minutes a day.
>
> It can be anything - a hobby, a daily walk, reading, time with loved ones.
>
> Always remember that medicine is what you do. It doesn't define who you are. Let your curiosity and how you treat others define who you are as a person.

Replace "medicine" with your job, and that advice still applies.

By the end of 2023, I was burned out. I wasn't doing anything that Dr. Tucker recommends.

I wasn't practicing my hobbies. I wasn't taking care of my body. I had stomach issues. Everything I ate sent me to the bathroom. Awful! And [I had all my sense of value in my job title]({% post_url 2025-01-07-DiversifyYourJoy %}). Wrong, wrong, wrong!

[I had to go through a burnout season]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}) to realize I am more than a job title and there's more to life than working 8 hours in a virtual cubicle. I had to let go of the idea of climbing the corporate ladder. And I had to create my own rules for success and life.

Since then, I redefined myself, from Software Engineer to lifelong learner. And I decided to [write 10 bad ideas]({% post_url 2024-11-05-IdeaMachine %}) and write something every single day as the things outside of coding.

## "The world will always be filled with uncertainty and challenging times"

One world war. The Great Depression. Another war. More than one economic crisis. In 102 years of life and almost 80 years of practice, Dr. Tucker has gone through a lot.

His advice to young generations on making it through uncertain times?

> My advice is focus on what you can control - your effort, attitude, and how you treat others. The world will always be filled with uncertainty and challenging times, but resilience is timeless.

Dr. Tucker is living proof that learning should never stop. And neither should we. Longevity isn't about secrets. It's about good habits that care for both mind and body. [Len, another 102-year-old WWII veteran, also recommends it]({% post_url 2025-01-18-WW2Veteran %}).
