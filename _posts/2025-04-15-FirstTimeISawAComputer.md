An owl blinking in a large forest made us all jump in surprise.

It was back in 4th grade.

We all were sitting in a large conference room while a guest teacher disassembled a computer. He took every part, showed it to the class, and told us its name.

That year, the school competition was to build a computer out of recycled materials.

I built mine with boxes and Styrofoam. OK, when I say "I built," I mean my mom or my aunt. I don't remember exactly who. My display was made with an old X-ray image.

We exhibited our computers on tables in the school hall while a group of teachers walked around taking notes, trying to find the most creative one.

I didn't win the competition. My X-ray display wasn't enough to win.

But after the competition, I put my computer on my desk at home. I pretended to work with it. Sometimes I still pretend.

After putting all the parts back in place, the guest teacher turned it on.

We all jumped in surprise. We started pointing at an owl blinking in a large forest. After a few seconds, the forest became an enchanted house with bats flying around. I was frozen sitting next to my friends, staring at that thing. Whatever it was that thing.

It was an animated wallpaper. LOL. It must have been Windows 95 or 98.

I don't remember what happened to my first computer ever.

But, fast forward a few years, we had our first real computer at home. Or my second one.

It was a Windows 98 computer with a 56K internet connection plugged into a wired phone line. Oh! The famous buzz when we picked up the phone while my dad was connected to the internet. The days of Yahoo and Altavista. 

Only my dad used the computer because "it wasn't a toy."

We had to restart the computer after every minor configuration and every software installation. We used a protection filter on our displays. They were almost radioactive. And after using it, we put pajamas on our computer before going to sleep. Dust was its arch-enemy.

My favorite wallpaper was an astronaut jumping around in outer space. That was Windows 98.

And that's how old I am.
