Hey, there.

Here are 4 thought-provoking links I found this week. Plus my reflections after a week off social media.

**#1.** AI makes code cheaper, but cheap code means not understanding what you're building. "Use AI or stay behind" shouldn't be the real mantra. It should be [rely on AI and get left behind](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2026/02/21/is-comprehension-debt-in-your-risk-register/) (4min).

**#2.** College and bootcamps don't teach the skills you need for real-world coding. That's why I wrote [Street-Smart Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding), by the way. This week, I found an updated version of [The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), a free course covering text editing, version control, agentic coding, and other skills nobody else teaches.

**#3.** Do you want to see a blue shield on your LinkedIn profile? Think twice after seeing [all the data LinkedIn and friends collect to verify us](https://thelocalstack.eu/posts/linkedin-identity-verification-privacy/) (12min).

**#4.** Now with cheaper code it's finally time to tackle [the real bottlenecks](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2026/02/23/will-you-finally-address-your-development-bottlenecks-in-2026/) (3min). And no, coding and typing were never the bottleneck.

I spent last week away from social media, and it turns out [I'm another dopamine junkie]({% post_url 2026-02-24-NoSocialMediaWeek %}) (4min), even with mindful use and a timer. Arrggg!

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... _Street-Smart Coding,_ 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

Until next Friday. Keep coding smartly
