For the first time, I'm putting my numbers out there.

Mark Thompson shared his stats [on Medium](https://articles.thesystematicwriter.com/accountability-first-where-i-stand-lets-grow-from-here-70a03bac5a35?sk=a9b2b3818b6843e5758115ab709cd9a7). The point wasn't to show off, but to hold ourselves accountable with our growing goals.

## Here are some of my stats, starting 2026:

**#1. Blog:** My blog is [my content hub]({% post_url 2024-12-15-BloggingWorkflow %}). All my ideas start or end on my blog. Then, I syndicate in other places.

Total so far: 708 posts. Last year, I posted daily and hit the [400-daily posts milestone]({% post_url 2025-12-06-400DailyPosts %}). For a recap, here's my [2025 in review]({% post_url 2026-01-01-BestOf2025 %}).

**#2. Medium:** This is my main driver of traffic and book sales. Last year, I saw a big bump in views and followers. So far: 1,197 followers and 643 subscribers.

**#3. LinkedIn:** This is my only social media channel, where I reshare bite-sized posts. So far: 832 followers and 364 connections.

**#4. dev.to:** I use dev.to only for coding content.

I have a "funny" follower count: 28,552. Mostly inactive accounts. When you create a new account, the welcome wizard asks you to choose tags and follow people.

More accurate stats: 236 posts, 1,921 reactions, and 549 comments.

**#5. Gumroad:** This is my store for [courses and books](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=start-year-stats-keep-accountable). Last year:  202 sales, 3,530 views, and [one new book launched](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=start-year-stats-keep-accountable).

**#6. Friday Links:** This is the "backend" for my product sales. Each Friday, I send 4 curated links. So far: 146 subscribers and 53 issues sent.

## My plan for 2026

In 2026, I'm focusing on simplifying my content strategy, not chasing followers.

Here's what I'm doing:
* I'm using dev.to API to automatically repost my posts with a simple script.
* I'm simplifying my [promotion strategy]({% post_url 2025-10-11-ContentThatSells %}) for my books.
* I'm repurposing Medium highlights on LinkedIn.

In 2026, I'm doubling down on a simple, repeatable system instead of vanity metrics.
