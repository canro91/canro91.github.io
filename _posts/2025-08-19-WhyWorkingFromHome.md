Today life threw me a curve ball and forced me out of my home office.

It was rush hour and I was still across town. Errands took me so long that I didn't make it home before 5:00PM.

I waited for 15 minutes next to ~100 people at a bus stop. After watching the time, I asked the lady in front of me, "Is it like this every day or just today?" "Yes! Every day! It's rush hour," she said.

I got so desperate that I walked for 10 minutes to the closest bus terminal. Every stop had at least a dozen people waiting for the same bus. At the bus terminal, I waited for ~5 minutes for the right bus.

Forty minutes later, I reached the closest station to home. It felt like a trip to the next city. Then another 5 minutes in line charging my card for tomorrow. And finally, another 10 minutes walking home.

At home, I'd have been getting ready to work out or simply reading a book. And I still don't get why people ask me if I like to [work from home]({% post_url 2025-03-03-Boundaries %}).
