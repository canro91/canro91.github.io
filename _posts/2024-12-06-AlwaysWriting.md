That's better than simply claiming on your CV that you did something.

Write about what you're doing and what you're learning at work. For example, write about:
* Challenges you're facing while solving a problem.
* Lessons you're learning from every project.
* Checklist you use to review pull requests.
* Most common code review comments you give.
* Difficult situations you have overcome.

I wrote [my first post]({% post_url 2023-07-18-FiveYearsOfBlogging %}) to document an alternative for a coding task I had. For my [2022 Advent of Posts]({% post_url 2022-12-01-AdventOfCode2022 %}), I took a lot of inspiration from what I was doing at work at that time.

There are always alternatives to avoid disclosing real code. 99% of the time, we're not doing top-secret rocket science. But companies don't want the world to know how they're doing CRUD applications.

You can share isolated coding blocks and use different business domains to represent examples and coding issues. Using movies, posts, and reservations is a good alternative.

Instead of saying "trust me, I know how to do that," you could say "I've done it and here's where I wrote about it."
