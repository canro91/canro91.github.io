In [How to title your blog post or whatever](https://dynomight.net/titles/), there's this tip for headlines or titles:

> _"Consider title-driven thing creation. That is, consider first choosing a title and then creating a thing that delivers on the title. It’s sad to admit, but I think there are many good things that simply don’t have good titles. Consider not making those things... In practice, it’s often something in the middle: You start to create your thing, then you choose a title, then you structure your thing to deliver on the title."_

Title-driven creation not only applies to blog posts, but also to other forms of creative output:
* Before making a course or paid product, write its landing page.
* Before [writing a book]({% post_url 2024-12-27-WritingABook %}), choose a title, write a summary, and design its cover.

Before creating, write the marketing materials first. For blog posts and social media content, that's the headline.

Every headline is a promise. Keep your promises, and your readers will trust you.
