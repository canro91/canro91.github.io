Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** Junior me wanted to refactor everything around me to follow "conventions." Mid-level me worked extra hours and on weekends to prove I was "committed." The thing is as we get more senior, [all those implicit expectations change](https://tahahussain.substack.com/p/how-senior-engineers-lose-trust) (5min). They often make you lose trust.

**#2.** Early developers didn't have StackOverflow or YouTube or ChatGPT. They relied on "skill, curiosity, and persistence." Wow! I found [a post about RFC](https://ackreq.github.io/posts/what-are-rfcs/) (13min), (the documents with the building block of the Internet), but I found a manifesto for coding creativity.

**#3.** As AI-generated content floods social media and the whole internet, we need places where there's still a human touch. And [that might be your own website](https://marcus-obst.de/blog/websites-are-for-humans) (4min).

**#4.** These days, we all agree on one thing: there's too much hype around AI. It's the new tool in town promising to kill coders. But that's not [the majority view on AI](https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/) (5min) and someone dares to say it out loud.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [AI being a sloppy junior coder]({% post_url 2025-10-20-SloppyAI %}) (2min) and [my 5 writing principles for consistency]({% post_url 2025-10-19-WritingPrinciples %}) (2min).

Ten years ago, I thought coding was only about syntax and languages. I was wrong! It's about collaboration, communication, and skills far from the keyboard. That's why I wrote _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding,_ the guide I wish I had on my journey from junior to senior.

See you next time,
