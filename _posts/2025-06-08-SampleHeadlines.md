What started as mindless scrolling on Medium yesterday turned into a headline-writing exercise.

I decided to stop scrolling like a zombie and pay attention to the headlines I found. To practice, I rewrote some headlines for clarity and curiosity. I wanted to follow [a top Medium writer's formula for engaging headlines]({% post_url 2025-06-05-IrresistibleHeadlines %}).

Here are 5 headlines I found, plus my versions:
 
## 1. "Rethinking the Value of Doing Nothing"

This was a short story about a random walk in the park. An old man sitting on the grass made the author reflect on rest and productivity.

**My version:** "An Old Man Sitting in the Park Changed My Mind About Productivity"

## 2. "My Experience With ChatGPT"

My first thought: why should I care? Who are you? What did you use ChatGPT for? This post was from a writer who tried ChatGPT to speed up her writing process.

**My version:** "I Hired ChatGPT as My Writing Intern—Here's What I Learned"

## 3. "7 Things That Show You're Making Progress"

Making progress in what? A video game? Business? This was a post about small signs of progress when nothing else seems to be working.

**My version:** "7 True Signs You're Making Progress in Life (Even When Nothing Seems to Work)"

## 4. "The Beautiful Habit I've Picked Up Lately"

This headline is too vague. A habit for what? Health? Business? A habit to achieve what? What makes it beautiful? This was a post about starting meaningful conversations.

**My version:** "This Simple Habit Has Taught Me More About Human Connection (Than Any Self-Help Book)"

## 5. "7 Obvious Signs Top Email Scammers Use to Contact You"  

This was a post dissecting an email with the classic fake job listing scam. Its headline could benefit from more drama.

**My version:** "Ignore These 7 Signs and You'll Fall Prey to Email Scammers Offering You Fake Jobs"

Clear beats clever. "On writing" or "On the value of consistency" tells us nothing. I declare myself guilty, too. A headline isn't just a title, it's a promise. Keep it clear, or lose your readers.
