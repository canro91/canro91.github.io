True wealth isn't just about money.

Apart from money, wealth also means health and freedom. Physical, emotional, and spiritual health. And freedom to choose to work on what you want, when you want, surrounded by people you want.

That was what Dan Koe and Sahil Bloom talked about during the next interview:

Here are 10 lessons I learned from that conversation:

#1. **Not all time is equal.** When you say "yes" to business or work, chances are you're saying "no" to time with your loved ones.

#2. **Imagine your funeral and ask yourself, who would be there?** It might sound creepy, but start investing in your relationships. The simplest way to do that is by texting your friends when you remember them.

#3. **Audit your calendar for energy creators and energy drainers.** Find what makes you feel alive and what does not. Double down on your energy creators. And if you can't avoid your energy drainers, batch them.

#4. **Entrepreneurship is creating.** It's about finding a problem, coming up with a solution, and scaling that solution. And you don't have to leave your full-time job to be an entrepreneur.

#5. **Master storytelling and sales.** Life is about sales. We're constantly negotiating and selling, since we're kids.

#6. Having a hard time niching down? **Find something you'd stick to for 5-10 years.**

#7. **Question the things you "have" to.** Question the default path. Create your own path.

#8. **Define your enough life.** How does your ideal day look like? When will you stop chasing the next step? The next promotion? The next milestone? What's your enough?

#9. **Use 30 minutes to 1 hour to create the life you want.** If you can work 8 hours to make somebody else's dream come true, you can work 1 hour to build yours.

#10. **Have a Life Dinner with your partner or with yourself.** Use that time to reflect and recalibrate.

Better than being just a millionaire is to become a time millionaire, prioritizing what truly matters to you and living under your own terms.
