title: From Zero to your first PR with Git and Github
description: This is a presentation I gave (remotely) for a group of friends from my city during the quarantine for the 2020 world pandemic (Yes, there was a world pandemic in 2020. It's on Wikipedia). It covers from installing Git to opening your first PR for an OSS project with Github. At the end of the presentation, participants could use Git basic workflow and open their first PR to an Open Source project

# From Zero to your first PR with Git and Github

### Cesar Aguirre

_Software engineer, lifelong learner_

## Why?

_Have you ever done something like this?_

```bash
> ls

Project-2020-04-01/
Project-2020-04-02/
Project-2020-04-03/
Project-Final/
Project-Final-Revised/
Project-Final-Final/
Project-Final-Final-Final/
Project-ThisIsNOTTheFinal/
Project-ThisIsTheFinal/
```

Youâ€™re doing it wrong!

## Version Control System

From the book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control):

_Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later._

It allows to 

* revert a file or an entire project to a previous state
* compare changes of a file over time
* see who modified something

## Git: what is it?

<img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logo@2x.png" width="110" height="46">

* distributed version control system
* fast and lightweight
* free and open source
* flexible branch model
* developed by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel
* the most commonly used version control system today

---

## How to install

Head to [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

On MacOs

```bash
$ brew install git
```

On Windows with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

```powershell
> choco install git.install
```

On Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

---

## First-time setup

### Your identity

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

.footnote[Source: [First-Time Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)]

---

## How to start

### Create a new repo locally

```bash
$ git init
```

### Clone an existing repo

```bash
$ git clone <url>
```

For example, `$ git clone https://github.com/canro91/BaseXml`

---

## Saving changes

1. Create a file
```bash
$ echo 'This is a demo of Git basic concepts' >> README.md
```

2. Save your changes
```bash
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m 'Add README file'
```

.footnote[Source: [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/about/staging-area)]

---

## Ignore files

There are files you don't want to track. For example: log files, files generated after building, folders generated by your IDE

Create a `.gitignore` file

```bash
[Bb]in/
[Oo]bj/
[Ll]og/
[Ll]ogs/
```

.footnote[[A collection of templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore), [More Ignore patterns](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore#ignoring-a-previously-committed)]

---

## Commit message style guide

_Are you commiting with messages like "Uploading changes"?_

A commit message should answer:

* Why is this change necessary?
* How does it address the issue?
* What side effects does this change have?

.footnote[Source: [5 Useful Tips For A Better Commit Message](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)]

---

## Branches

_Create an alternate timeline to work without messing with the main line_

The default branch name is `master`

1. Create a branch
```bash
$ git branch testing
```

2. Move to the new branch
```bash
$ git checkout testing
```

Alternatively, you can combine these two commands into a single one

```bash
$ git checkout -b testing
```

---

## Merging

1. Move to the desired branch
```bash
$ git checkout master
```

2. Merge a branch
```bash
$ git merge testing
```

3. Delete a merged branch
```bash
$ git branch -d testing
```

---

## Merge and conflicts

If you modified the same parts of a file in different branches, Git won't be able to merge them cleanly. *Now you have a conflict.*

Git uses markers to delimit conflicted areas.

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
Some content
=======
Another content
>>>>>>> branch 
```

---

## Sync

_What if you want your code to have a home outside your computer?_

You need a "remote". For example: GitHub, Gitlab and Bitbucket.

1. Add a remote
```bash
$ git remote add <name> <url>
```

2. Upload your changes
```bash
$ git push <branch> <remote>
```

For example, `$ git remote add origin https://github.com/canro91/GitDemo.git`

---

## Github

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Font_Awesome_5_brands_github.svg/54px-Font_Awesome_5_brands_github.svg.png)

Github is a hosting solution for Git, recently acquired by Microsoft. It's kind of a social network

* Unlimited private repositories
* Bug tracking
* Task management
* Wikis
* Follow developers
* Star projects
* Be part of communities

_Some people use their Github profile as CV_

---

## Pull Request

* A pull request is a request to include some changes from my fork into the original repo

* Fork means create an identical copy of a repo and become the owner

---

## Cheatsheet

* `git init`
* `git clone <url>`
* `git status`
* `git add <file>`
* `git commit -m 'A commit message'`
* `git log --oneline --graph`
* `git branch <branch-name>`
* `git checkout <branch-name>`
* `git merge <branch-name>`
* `git remote add <name> <url>`
* `git push origin <branch-name>`
* `git pull origin <branch-name>`

---

## Let's Practice

* Install Git locally
* Create a Github account
* Open your first PR

Head to [firstcontributions/first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) and follow the instructions to open your first PR using either the command line or your favorite IDE.
