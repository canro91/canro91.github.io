Show your work is a New York Times bestseller by Austin Kleon. He describes his book as _"a book for people who hate the very idea of self-promotion"_. This book tells you how and why you should show your work online. It quotes artists and well-known figures to make each chapter more memorable.

**Good work isn't enough. "Show your work" teaches that your work has to be out there. If your work isn't online, it doesn't exist**.

**"Be so good they can't ignore you"** summarizes the purpose of the book. To not to be ignored, you have to be findable. Build a routine of sharing. Take advantage of your network. Imagine you don't need a resume because your next boss already reads your blog.

## You don't have to be a genius

**Creativity is about collaboration too**. Find a place where you can share your ideas and flourish your creativity. Find your creativity circle or scenius. Famous musicians and artists were surrounded by other artists to share, copy, acknowledge and sparkle their ideas.

Ask yourself what you want to learn. And make a commitment of learning in front of others. Share what you love and the people who love the same thing will find you.

## Share something small every day

**There is no such a thing as overnight success**. At the end of the day, see what you can share: inspiration, progress or learning. Share what you think it's helpful or entertaining.

Don't be afraid of sharing your work. 90% of everything is crap. But, don't turn into a human spam.

## Open up your cabinet of curiosities

**Have a cabinet of curiosities**. Before museums, people had a place to put what they loved, usually rare and weird things. Think you're a collector.

Before you can share your work, you can share your taste. You can share what you read, who you follow, what inspires you. Credit your sources. Don't share things you can't credit.

Voilà! These are my takeaways from Show Your Work. This isn't a book about programming, but it has inspired me to continue writing, even when I think nobody is reading.
