Good work isn't enough. This book teaches your work has to be out there. **If your work isn't online, it doesn't exist**.

"Be so good they can't ignore you" summarizes the purpose of the book. To not to be ignored, you have to be findable. Build a routine of sharing. Take advantage of your network. Imagine you don't need a resume because your next boss already reads your blog.

## You don't have to be a genius

**Creativity is about collaboration too**. Find a place where you can share your ideas and flourish your creativity. Find your scenius. Famous musicians and artists were surrounded by other artists to share, copy, acknowledge and sparkle their ideas.

Ask yourself what you want to learn. Make a commitment of learning in front of others. Share what you love and the people who love the same thing will find you.

> _"The minute you learn something, teach it"_

## Share something small every day

**There is no such a thing as overnight success**. At the end of the day, see what you can share: inspiration, progress or learning. Share what you think it's helpful or entertaining.

Don't be afraid of sharing your work. 90% of everything is crap. But, don't turn into a human spam.

## Open up your cabinet of curiosities

**Have a cabinet of curiosities**. Before museums, people had a place to put what they loved, usually rare and weird things. Think you're a collector.

Before you can share your work, you can share your taste. You can share what you read, who you follow, what inspires you. Credit your sources. Don't share things you can't credit.
