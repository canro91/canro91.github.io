Hey there.

Before the usual 4 links, a quick update about my book.

This week, I finished another four chapters. But there's still work to do.

I haven't chosen a final book title, but what about _30 Ways to Get Better at Coding_? What do you think? Does it sound interesting?

And... Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. Forty years ago, Programming Pearls was released, a collection of hard truths about coding. But are they still relevant? Here's [a breakdown of those pearls](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/09/40-years-later-are-bentleys-programming-pearls-still-relevant/) (20min).

#2. Here's [why the guy who stopped the largest cyberattack in history hates AI](https://malwaretech.com/2025/08/every-reason-why-i-hate-ai.html) (30min).

#3. Want to understand the AI hype? [It's not a technology, but a subscription company](https://idiallo.com/blog/ai-is-a-subscription-company) (6min).

#4. Speaking of coding in the old days, here's [how ADA handled code formatting](https://maxleiter.com/blog/formatting) (4min).

And in case you missed it, this week I was invited to a firechat session with the LAX Africa community to discuss how to land a first job. Here's [a summary of the session]({% post_url 2025-09-11-ALXSept2025 %}) (5min).
