This is another episode where I share the talks from NDC Conference I watched and liked. This time is about JavaScript, History, and Design.

## How JavaScript Happened: A Short History of Programming Languages - Mark Rendle

This is a journey from FORTRAN to ALGOL to LISP to JavaScript. It explains why we still use `if` for conditional, `i` for loops, and `*` for multiplication. Spoiler alert: It's because of FORTRAN.

## Apache Kafka in 1 hour for C# Developers - Guilherme Ferreira

Clusters, Topics, Partitions, producers/consumers? This is a good first-time introduction to Kafka. The presenter uses [kafkaflow](https://github.com/Farfetch/kafkaflow) and [confluent-kafka-dotnet](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet) for the demo application.

## Keynote: Why web tech is like this - Steve Sanderson

I found this one on r/programming (before the Reddit blackout) Informative! It feels like time traveling through operating systems and tools to create a Web page.

## Pilot Critical Decision Making skills - Clifford Agius

The lesson from this one is to come up with a list of things that could go wrong and prepare and train for that. Follow TDODAR approach: Time, Diagnosis, Options, Decision, Assign, and Review.

## Intentional Code - Minimalism in a World of Dogmatic Design

I like the idea that "software really is literature." Not in the sense of literate programming but in the sense of a narrative to express idea where every line of code matters. I like the example of how a piece of code improves by only removing a few blank lines.

Another idea I liked is: "You don't want everything to look the same." We don't want all applications to use Domain-Driven Design with Event Sourcing and microservices. Often architectural patterns only add to cognitive load and extra complexity.

The presenter suggests: "sitting and looking at it (at a piece of code) and working out how it makes you feel. And then when you feel something, try to understand why it feels that way."
