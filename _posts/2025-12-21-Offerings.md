What happens when AI codes better than we do?

For a second, let's forget AI is more like [a sloppy junior coder]({% post_url 2025-10-20-SloppyAI %}). Let's stop [feeling like cheating]({% post_url 2025-11-11-Cheating %}) when prompting instead of typing. If AI writes reliable code, what would we offer as coders?

In a [past Friday Links]({% post_url 2025-12-19-FridayLinks %}), I shared one post from Leon Mika that made me ask those questions.

[Leon wrote](https://lmika.org/2025/12/14/maybe-writing-code-is-no.html),

> _Maybe writing code is no longer part of my "core offering" at this point in my career. Maybe it is the "judgement, tradeoffs, intents" and all the other buzzwords people throw around when describing a senior software engineer._

Leon's post made me think what we could offer. Here's my list:
1. Talking to end users to find out what they need
2. Choosing what features to implement
3. Choosing the right tools, stack, and frameworks
4. Scoping projects into milestones or sprints
5. Finding what to rewrite and when
6. Coming up with de-risking plans
7. Choosing the right time to scale
8. Sharing past mistakes and lessons
9. Vetting what to build, buy, or outsource
10. Finding cost-effective "cloudification" strategies

Some coders already do those tasks, but soon they'll be everyday work for all of us.

In the meantime, [AI is making us rediscover the practice of coding]({% post_url 2025-11-01-AIGift %}). And that's already a good point for AI.

When AI shines at coding, we need strong product thinking, communication, and other skills I cover in _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding._ That's the roadmap I wish I had to become a senior coder.
