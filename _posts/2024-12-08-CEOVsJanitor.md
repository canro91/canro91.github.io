More than 25% of new Google code is generated by AI.

That's what Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, announced in the last earnings callâ€”Q3 2024.

That's scary. Not because AI is taking our jobs, but because they're relying on who knows what kind of code. And if human-generated code has created all sorts of problems, what about the AI-generated code?

That announcement generated lots of discussions.

[On Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42002212), a Google employee, probably behind a throwaway account, said that AI is autocompleting the lines he writes, but it doesn't do any actual engineering or generate code from natural language. I was wrong about my initial thought.

On LinkedIn, there was a post dismantling that announcement and pointing to that Hacker News comment. Of course, someone didn't believe what the Google employee wrote in that comment. "Would you trust a random employee?"

If you really want to know how a company is run, do you ask the CEO or someone with boots on the ground?

The best one to answer how a company runs is the receptionist, janitor, or an entry-level employee, not the CEO.

The CEO of a million-dollar company, to raise stock prices and invite investors to throw money at them, will say "AI," "disruption," "climate change," "diversity," or any trending SEO keyword.

I don't believe what Google's CEO said. I believe that random Hacker News comment.
