I know we're not supposed to multitask.

But recently, while doing the dishes, I listened to [this YouTube interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSgLWVPmfqI) between Ryan Holiday and Robert Greene, two best-selling writers.

Out of all the subjects they talked about, there's one line that I still remember:

> _"It's all material"_

They both share how problematic people and unexpected situations end up being material for an email or a book.

## And that line made me think about unexpected situations that have inspired me to write.

#1. The other day I took a loved one to a hospital. And I ended up writing about [calming my mind]({% post_url 2025-04-19-CalmDown %}), [the future of hospital visits with AI]({% post_url 2025-04-20-MedAI %}), and [random facts about health]({% post_url 2025-05-08-RandomLessons %}), which I learned on that visit.

#2. Another day, a cashier overheard a conversation I had with a friend, and her reaction inspired me to write about [our definition of success]({% post_url 2025-04-08-SuccessMetrics %}).

#3. I used to feel guilty about watching movies and series. But when I started watching them through a creator's lens, I realized how much they could teach about storytelling and writing. I've watched and written about [Six Triple Eight]({% post_url 2025-03-13-SixTripleEight %}), [Scorpion]({% post_url 2024-12-09-Scorpion %}), and [House M.D.]({% post_url 2025-05-18-HouseMD %}). No more guilt. Just writing lessons. After all, It's all material.
