A Redditor recently asked for tips to become a better programmer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1mnvsj9/what_do_you_wish_you_knew_when_you_started_coding/). The kind of tips we wish we had known when we started coding.

> _I've been taking a few courses here and there for c# as a side language I’m learning. Curious if you know something I don’t and have tips for making other newcomers a better programmer... Lmk what you wish you could have learned earlier thst would of helped you progress faster!_

I already wrote about [four career lessons I wish I had known here]({% post_url 2022-12-12-ThingsToKnowBeforeBeingSoftwareEngineer %}). But there's a coding lesson before those four.

You're not going to like it, but:

## Don't obsess over syntax and programming languages.

Coding isn't about learning every feature of a language.

You don't need a huge list of tools to start. With HTML/CSS/JavaScript, one backend language, and a good amount of SQL, you have enough to make your way through the coding world.

You could learn the rest by doing and Googling.

## More important than syntax and languages is product thinking.

Instead of obsessing with the best language features, think in terms of the product you're building.

Ask the questions most coders wouldn't dare (or care) to ask:

* Are we building what users really need?
* How will they use our product?
* How many users will we have?
* How much are we charging?

Ask about marketing, sales, or anything beyond coding. Get interested in the business behind the code you're writing.

That attitude will make you [stand out in any team]({% post_url 2025-02-26-StandOutAtWork %}). It will save you from building the wrong features or [optimizing for a scale you won't have]({% post_url 2025-05-17-NeedForScale %}).

Product thinking will open doors to climb the corporate ladder faster.

## There's more than symbols on text files.

After 10+ years, I've learned that [the more senior you become]({% post_url 2025-06-14-Senior %}), the less it's about syntax and the more it's about how you collaborate, [communicate]({% post_url 2025-07-14-CommAtWork %}), and solve business problems.

I wish someone had told me that earlier. As a junior coder, I obsessed over learning languages and ignored other valuable skills: product thinking, teamwork, and clear communication.

And that's why I wrote _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding,_ the guide to the lessons I wish I'd known from day one.
