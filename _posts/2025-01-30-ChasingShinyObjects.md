"Focus on learning one thing."

I heard that from a coworker at my first job. At that time, he was the IT/network guy. Years before that, he was a certified Java engineer or something.

I was new at this coding thing. I was trying to learn about everything at once. It was back in 2010ish. I was reading [The Clean Code]({% post_url 2020-01-06-CleanCodeReview %}), learning Python, using C# at work (coming from Java), and watching PHP presentations in my lunch break.

Passion without direction.

I remember that story because today I read this post titled, [why juniors are burning out before they bloom](https://medium.com/mr-plan-publication/why-junior-developers-are-burning-out-before-they-bloom-surviving-techs-obsession-with-new-771b52e0f646?sk=d62dbf687f23dc1ebc3c8d6bcf48a5d7), on Medium.

It says that instead of chasing new and shiny objects like tools, libraries, and frameworks, juniors are better off going deep into fewer tools and concepts. Oh there's a new framework. [A new C# version]({% post_url 2024-07-08-CSharpInconsistencies %}). A new CI/CD tool. Arrggg!

Frameworks and libraries come and go.

Today it's React with Typescript. Before that, it was Bootstrap with Ember or Knockout.js. And before that, it was WebForms. And before that, I guess it was Perl scripts or something.

And who knows what [AI will bring to the table]({% post_url 2024-04-29-2034Predictions %}).

But chances are we'll be working on a C-type language, still using text files, and writing SQL. That hasn't changed in ~50 years. And it will remain the same. I wouldn't bet all my money though.

If you're starting your coding journey, master the topics that have passed the test of time: HTTP, debugging, C, design patterns, data structures, clean code principles (not necessarily the book), Linux, vanilla JS.

And more importantly than spitting out code, master your soft skills: negotiation and persuasion. Coding is more about collaboration than cracking symbols on a file.
