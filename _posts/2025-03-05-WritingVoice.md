The biggest mistake all new writers make is trying to sound like a "writer."

That's because we're more used to reading fiction. And we try to do the same. But we end up writing long sentences and using complicated words.

Instead of pretending to be a writer, [write for a single person in mind]({% post_url 2024-12-24-WritingVoice %}). That's what I do.

But these days, I've found another technique to bring out your inner and real voice out when writing.

It comes from Henrik Karlsson from Escaping Flatland. He wrote in [Advice for a friend who wants to start a blog](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/start-a-blog):

> #4. People tend to sound more like themselves in chat messages than in blog posts. So perhaps write in the chat, rapidly, to a friend.

When we're texting friends or family, we don't use jargon, fluff, or long sentences. We use the tone we use in a face-to-face conversation. A text box inside WhatsApp brings your inner voice out.

The next time you sit down to write, open a chat with yourself and let your true voice flow.
