You know you're growing when:
* You don't get stuck on compilation errors for missing semicolons
* You're not rushing to code without doing some planning
* You know when your code looks or feels funny

But there's another subtle sign of growth:

**You let others into your code and you don't take critiques on your code personally.**

## Being an overprotective coder

Oh boy! [In my first job]({% post_url 2024-09-02-LessonsFromMyFirstCodingJob %}), I didn't want anyone else to touch my code.

Each team member worked solo, with almost no collaboration. And after finishing [Clean Code]({% post_url 2020-01-06-CleanCodeReview %}), I thought only my code met all the standards. I didn't want anyone else to infect it.

Then at my next job, it was almost the same story.

Along with a small team, I worked on the core features of the main app. Only a few touched it. And it hurt to see my code rewritten during the app redesign to make it scale.

## Learning not to be one with the code

After moving between projects and companies, I eventually learned that I'm not my code.

Critiquing my code isn't critiquing me. [Bugs happen]({% post_url 2020-09-19-ThreeDebuggingTips %}). Edge cases get missed. Requirements get misunderstood. And when that happens, someone will pick my code and say "Who wrote this crap?" The same way I said that when I inherited somebody else's codebase.

Get your code in front of others, let them change it, tweak it, and critique it.

That's the key to growing as a coder. And that's why I wrote _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding._ Nobody told junior me that writing simple code others could inherit and improve was part of growing.

_[Grab your copy of Street-Smart Coding here](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=subtle-sign-youre-growing)_ This is the roadmap I wish I had on my journey from junior to senior.
