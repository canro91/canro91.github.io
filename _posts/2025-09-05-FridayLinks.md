Hey, quick update from my side before sharing the usual four links:

I'm writing a book.

Yes, a book. One with 30 lessons to get better at coding. Those are the lessons I wish I had on my way from Junior to Senior. I'll share more details in future emails.

OK, the four links as usual:

#1. If [every company wants to hire "the best engineers"](https://www.otherbranch.com/shared/blog/no-you-dont-want-to-hire-the-best-engineers) (5min), who hires the rest of us?

#2. AI can't replace coders for real anytime soon. Here are [five AI screwups](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/vibe-coding-failures-that-prove-ai-cant-replace-developers-yet) (12min) that prove we're not there yet.

#3. We shouldn't blindly follow guidelines. Here's a breakdown of one: [doing the simplest things](https://www.seangoedecke.com/the-simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work/) (11min).

#4. Here's an interesting way of [repurposing an old phone into an ereader](https://www.davepagurek.com/blog/minimal-phone/) (15min).

***

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [two strategies for faster code reviews]({% post_url 2025-09-04-FasterCodeReviews %}) (3min) and [six pieces of advice I wish I had before going to college]({% post_url 2025-08-31-GoingToCollege %}) (2min).
