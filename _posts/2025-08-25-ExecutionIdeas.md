title: "Good Ideas Aren't Enoughâ€”You Need Execution Ideas Too"

Since last year, I've made a habit to write 10 ideas a day.

That's a concept I learned from [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}). I even followed some of the exercises from "How to Become an Idea Machine," a book with dozens of prompts to exercise your idea muscles.

[Writing those 10 ideas]({% post_url 2025-03-23-BecomingAnIdeaMachine %}) has taught me we need plenty of bad ideas to find a good one. And once we find a good idea, we need ideas to execute it.

Did you come up with [a book idea]({% post_url 2025-04-22-BookForGrandkids %})? Great. The next step is writing another 10 to (possibly) make that book a reality. Do you need research? Do you need to compile scattered blog posts? Do you need to test subjects first on social media?

This applies beyond writing books. These days, a neighbor decided to change our main door lock. It was rusty and in poor shape. That was a good idea. But he didn't let everybody else know and didn't have enough key copies for everyone. That was bad execution. Good ideas need good execution ideas too.
