Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** I've been thinking about how to adopt AI. I don't want to outsource coding. I still want my hands dirty. I thought we should be like the lead surgeon in an operating room. But I'm not the only one [thinking to code like a surgeon](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/10/24/code-like-a-surgeon) (6min).

**#2.** We can reduce the whole clean code discussion to a few principles, like "separate specific code from generic code" (That's the one I cover in Street-Smart Coding, by the way). But there's a similar one: [pure core, impure shell](https://testing.googleblog.com/2025/10/simplify-your-code-functional-core.html) (3min).

**#3.** The tech industry made me sick last year, literally and figuratively. It was life-changing, though not as serious as [surviving a stroke](https://blog.j11y.io/2025-10-29_stroke_tips_for_engineers/) (5min). Even if you haven't had health issues, that's worth reading. You can always find a new job, but not a new body. You need boundaries.

**#4.** With big corporations eager to make money, the dream of [running what we want in our devices seems to be gone](https://hackaday.com/2025/10/22/what-happened-to-running-what-you-wanted-on-your-own-machine/) (10min).

Also on my blog this week, I shared about [the subtle sign you're growing as a coder]({% post_url 2025-10-29-SignOfGrowth %}) (2min) and [5 lessons from a mentor that helped me become senior]({% post_url 2025-10-25-LessonsFromMentor %}) (4min).

If you're looking to level up your coding skills, Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding is here. No more "preorder" or "just 5 tips to get you started."

Some of the lessons inside are conventional. Others were learned the hard way. And a few are weird. (One of the tips is to watch a TV show. Thatâ€™s on Chapter #29.) But all the tips and lessons are battle-tested.

[Grab your copy here](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=friday-links-coding-like-surgeon-surviving-stroke). Just for a few days, you can pay what you want (even $1 or $2). No tricks or treats.

See you next Friday,

Cesar
