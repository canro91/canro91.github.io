Hey there!

This week I'm relaunching my C# unit testing intro book.

During the holidays, I revamped _Unit Testing 101_ with clearer chapters, tighter explanations, and a fresh design.

If you already bought it, you should have received the new version. Otherwise, [grab it here](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/unittesting101).

Now, this week's 4 interesting links:

**#1.** StackOverflow feels dead. Maybe a victim of its own success. And [we were never good programmers](https://idiallo.com/blog/we-were-never-good-programmers) (5min).

**#2.** [AI is turning software (and coding) into fast fashion](https://tante.cc/2026/01/15/software-as-fast-fashion/) (6min). "Software is no longer seen as an asset... It’s a throw-away product. Like a napkin."

**#3.** New to a codebase? [Push the smallest possible change to production](https://ankursethi.com/blog/smallest-possible-change/) (3min), even a README tweak.

**#4.** Cool tool of the week: [maptoposter](https://github.com/originalankur/maptoposter). Turn your favorite city map into a beautiful poster.

Beyond coding, I wrote on my blog about [how I use LinkedIn mindfully]({% post_url 2026-01-19-LinkedIn %}) (3min) and [why you're still hungry after eating and how to fix it]({% post_url 2026-01-21-GlucoseSpikes %}) (3min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... the new version of _Unit Testing 101_. OK, I already told you about that. Check _Street-Smart Coding_: 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

See you next time,

Cesar
