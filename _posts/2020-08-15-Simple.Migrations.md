Do you email SQL scripts to a coworker to update your database schema? Do you update your database schema by hand? I've being there. Let's find out about database migrations with Simple.Migrations.

**A database migration is a uniquely identified operation to create, update or delete database objects. Migrations are a more scalable and maintainable alternative to running SQL scripts directly into your database to update its schema.**

## Let's migrate

Migrations allow you to create and setup testing and development environments easily.

Have you ever needed to create a new environment to reproduce an issue? But, you forgot to run one or two scripts to create columns in a table and your application couldn't even start. Then, you realized you had two problems. 

Migrations help you to keep your database schema and your SQL scripts under version control in sync.

No more emails with database scripts!

## Simple.Migrations

[Simple.Migrations](https://github.com/canton7/Simple.Migrations) _"is a simple bare-bones migration framework for .NET Core"_. It provides _"a set of simple, extendable, and composable tools for integrating migrations into your application"_.

Simple.Migrations has out-of-the-box [database providers](https://github.com/canton7/Simple.Migrations#database-providers) for SQL Server, SQLite, PostreSQL and MySQL. But, you can create your own provider too.

Let's create our first migration for an employees database using SQL Server.

### 1. Create a new Employees table

First, in a Console application, install Simple.Migrations NuGet package. Then, create a class `CreateEmployees` inheriting from the `Migration` base class. Don't forget to add the `using SimpleMigrations;` statement.

**With Simple.Migrations, all migrations should override two methods: Up and Down**.

The `Up()` method should contain database operation to apply. For example, creating a new table, adding a new column to an existing table, etc. And, the `Down()` method should contain the steps to rollback that operation. Remember, we want to apply and rollback migrations.

For our first migration, the `Up()` method will have the SQL statement to create the `Employees` table. And, the `Down()` method, the statement to remove it.

You can use the `Execute()` method from the `Migration` class to run your SQL statements. But, you have a `Connection` property of type `DbConnection` to bring your own database layer or ORM of choice.

**A migration should use be uniquely identified**.

You need to annotate your migration with a version number using the `[Migration]` attribute. Either a consecutive number or a timestamp-like number is fine.

Make sure to not to repeat the same version number. Otherwise, you will get a `MigrationLoadFailedException`.

This is our `CreateEmployees` migration with `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` statements.

```csharp
using SimpleMigrations;

[Migration(1)]
public class CreateEmployees : Migration
{
    protected override void Up()
    {
        Execute(@"CREATE TABLE Employees
                (
                    [Id] [int] PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
                    [SSO] [varchar](24) NOT NULL,
                    [FirstName] [varchar](255) NOT NULL,
                    [MiddleName] [varchar](255) NOT NULL,
                    [LastName] [varchar](255) NOT NULL,
                    [Salary] [decimal](18) NOT NULL,
                    [CreatedDate] [datetime] NULL,
                    [UpdatedDate] [datetime] NULL,
                )");
    }

    protected override void Down()
    {
        Execute(@"DROP TABLE Employees");
    }
}
```

I know, I know...Yes, I copied the SQL statement from SQL Server Management Studio Database Designer.

### 2. Apply our first migration

The next step is to update the Console application to run this migration.

Inside the `Main()` method of your console application, create a connection to your database and use the `SimpleMigrator` class. Its constructor needs the assembly containing the migrations and a database provider.

For our example, the `MssqlDatabaseProvider` is the appropriate provider.

With the `SimpleMigrator` class, you can use two methods: `MigrateTo()` and `MigrateToLatest()`.

`MigrateTo()` applies an specific version into your database. And `MigrateToLatest()`, all versions up to the latest one. Before using any of these two methods, make sure to call the `Load` method.

The `Main()` method of our console application looks like this.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var connString = @"Data Source=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Payroll;Integrated Security=True;";
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connString))
        {
            var databaseProvider = new MssqlDatabaseProvider(connection);
            var migrator = new SimpleMigrator(typeof(AssemblyWithYourMigrations).Assembly, databaseProvider);
            migrator.Load();
            migrator.MigrateToLatest();
        }
    }
}
```

Run your console application to apply your first migration.

Simple.Migrations creates a `dbo.VersionInfo` table on your database. This table keeps track of the applied migrations. It should look like this one.

Id | Version | AppliedOn | Description |
1 |	1 | 	8/13/2020 4:24:18 PM |	CreateEmployees

### 3. Add a column to an existing table

Now, suppose you need to add a `Type` column to the `Employees` table.

This time, create an `AddTypeToEmployee` class with the SQL statements needed. Remember, you need a different version number.

For example, the `AddTypeToEmployee` will look like this.

```csharp
[Migration(2)]
public class AddTypeToEmployee : Migration
{
    protected override void Up()
    {
        Execute(@"ALTER TABLE Employees
                  ADD Type VARCHAR(8) NULL");
    }

    protected override void Down()
    {
        Execute(@"ALTER TABLE Employees
                  DROP COLUMN Type");
    }
}
```

Again, run the console application. Notice how the `Employees` and `VersionInfo` tables have changed on your database.

### 4. A runner

Finally, you can create a runner to apply your migrations. Simple.Migrations has a predefined [console runner](https://github.com/canton7/Simple.Migrations#consolerunner).

We have a Console application that always applies all the migrations to the latest. We need more flexibility to apply any migration or rollback any other. 

Let's use .NET Core configuration options to move the connection string to a settings file. We have ours hardcoded into our Console application.

For this, you need two install two NuGet packages:

* `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`, and
* `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` 

Then, create an `appsettings.json` file with your connection string. Mine looks like this.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "YourConnString": "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Payroll;Integrated Security=True;"
  }
}
```

If you're using different environments (QA, Staging, for example), you can read the environment name from an environment variable.

Then, with the `ConfigurationBuilder` class, you can load the appropiate json file with our connection string per environment.

After using the console runner, our console application looks like this.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var connString = Configuration().GetConnectionString("YourConnString");
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connString))
        {
            var databaseProvider = new MssqlDatabaseProvider(connection);
            var migrator = new SimpleMigrator(typeof(AssemblyWithYourMigrations).Assembly, databaseProvider);

            var consoleRunner = new ConsoleRunner(migrator);
            consoleRunner.Run(args);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public static IConfigurationRoot Configuration()
    {
        var environmentName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT");

        var configurationBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
            .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{environmentName}.json", optional: true);
        return configurationBuilder.Build();
    }
}
```

Simple.Migrations default `ConsoleRunner` reads the commands `up` to migrate to the latest version, `to` to migrate to an specific version and `down` to revert back to a version. If the command arguments you provide are invalid, you will get a help message.

## Conclusion

Voil√†! That's how we can keep our database schema up to date with migrations and Simple.Migrations.

Migrations are a better alternative to running scripts directly into your database. You can use migrations to create constraints and indexes too. With migrations, your database structure is under version control and reviewed as it should be.

Your mission, Jim, should you decide to accept it, is to add a `Payments` table with a relation to the `Employees` table. It should contain an id, a date, a paid value and the employee id. This post will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.
