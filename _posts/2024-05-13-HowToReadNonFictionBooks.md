These days, I've started reading "E-Myth Revisited" by Michael Gerber. I noticed that I developed my own method of reading books. Today, I want to share it: this is how I read non-fiction books for more retention.

To read books, I follow a method based mainly on the Zettelkasten method, described in the book [How to Take Smart Notes]({% post_url 2020-11-18-HowToTakeSmartNotes %}). With the Zettelkasten method, we keep literature and permanent notes and follow a process to convert literature notes to permanent notes. It boils down to creating connections between notes.

I adapted the Zettelkasten method to use plain text instead of pieces of paper. [I'm a big fan of plain text]({% post_url 2020-08-29-HowITakeNotes %}).

The key to retain more from the books we read is to read actively. Read looking for answers and connecting what we read to previous learnings.

This is the six-step process I follow to read non-fiction books.

## Step 1: Intention

I switched from reading a book just for the sake of reading to reading a book to answer questions.

I don't jump into a book with the same attitude if I'm just curious about a subject or want to answer a particular question. I learned I don't have to read books from cover to cover.

For example, I started reading the "The E-Myth Revisited" to learn how to run a solo consulting practice.

## Step 2: Overview

Then, I have a grasp of the book and its content. I use reviews, summaries, podcast interviews, or anything else to understand the overall book content.

Recently, I started to experiment with Copilot for this step. I ask Copilot to generate an executive summary of a book, for example.

## Step 3: Note

Then, I create a new Markdown file for the book note. For every note, I use the date and the book title as the title.

I divide each book note into two halves. The first half is for questions and connections, and the second half is for the actual notes.

Also, I link to the new book note from the book index and the subject index. The book index is a note that links to all books I have read, in alphabetical order. The subject index is a note that references all other notes related to a specific subject. These two types of notes are entry points into my note vault.

For example, I could link to "The E-Myth Revisited" note from a "Consulting" index note.

## Step 4: Question

After creating a new note, I read the table of contents, introduction, and conclusion looking for the book's structure and interesting topics. I skim through the book to find anything that grabs my attention: boxes, graphs, and tables.

In the first half of the book note, I write questions I have about the subject and questions that arose after skimming the book. I got this idea of asking questions about a book before reading from [Jim Kwik's speed reading videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JimKwik).

If I decide not to read the book from cover to cover, I create an index of the chapters and sections I want to read or the ones I don't want to. I keep this index for future reference. I learned this idea from [SuperOrganizers' Surgical Reading](https://every.to/superorganizers/surgical-reading-how-to-read-12-books-580014).

## Step 5: Read

Then, I read the book while keeping note of interesting parts and quotes in the second half of my book note. I try not to copy and paste passages from the book into my notes but to write things in my own words, except for quotes.

After every chapter, I stop to recall the main ideas from that chapter.

Also, while reading the book, I answer the initial questions in the first half of the note.

## Step 6: Connections

While reading or after finishing a chapter, I notice connections with other subjects and my existing knowledge. I use the first half of the note to write these connections and link to other notes.

This is the step where I write my book critique: how this expands or contradicts anything else I've learned.

For these connections and critique, the Zettelkasten method recommends a separate set of notes: the permanent notes. The original Zettelkasten proponent used separate handwritten notes and slip boxes for his permanent notes. I keep my permanent notes in the same file but in the first half. This way, the next time I open it, I find my connections and critique first.

Voila! That's how I read non-fiction books. It's a combination of the Zettelkasten method with a pre-reading step and my own note structure.
