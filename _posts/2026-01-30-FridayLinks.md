Hey there.

This week marks three months since I launched [Street-Smart Coding](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP). It started in a notebook with a 10-idea list. Now it's a book. Getting the first paperback copies made me feel like a New York Times bestselling author. Pinch me, please.

After that quick update, here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** For months, we've been hearing that AI will replace coders. But a more realistic prediction is to say that [we won't be writing code by hand in 5 years](https://alexop.dev/posts/developers-wont-write-code-by-hand/) (10min). Truth is, coding was never the hard part.

**#2.** If you're looking for a tech job in 2026, instead of applying and sending out CVs everywhere, [make a target bet](https://www.seanmuirhead.com/blog/targeted-bets) (4min). Without knowing it, that's the strategy I followed to land my last contracting gig.

**#3.** With LLMs and agents, building in-house replacements for paid tools sounds tempting as a way to save some money). But [writing code is just the tip of the iceberg](https://priver.dev/blog/congratz-you-just-build-the-top-of-the-iceberg/) (5min).

**#4.** These days, American coworkers complain about the weather, and I keep converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Here's [a quick mental heuristic to do it](https://evanhahn.com/fahrenheit-celsius-heuristic/) (1min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [a new rule for using AI without losing my skills]({% post_url 2026-01-26-AnotherAIRule %}) (2min) and [how to be an expert at failing (and survive to tell the story)]({% post_url 2026-01-27-ExpertAtFailing %}) (5min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... _Street-Smart Coding,_ 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

Until next Friday, keep coding smart
