For so long, I was afraid of putting "writer" on my bio online.

I was full of self-doubt. "I don't have thousands of followers." "I don't have a novel." "I'm not even an English native speaker."

Even after [years of blogging]({% post_url 2023-07-18-FiveYearsOfBlogging %}), calling myself a writer was an impossible goal. Maybe because I pictured writers as Hemingways retreating to an island to return with a Nobel-winning novel.

I wish I had read Mark Thompson's post challenging the distinction between "real" writing and everything else sooner. It would have saved me so many moments of self-doubt. [He wrote](https://seriousmarketersonly.medium.com/the-snobbery-of-real-writing-and-why-you-should-ignore-it-720d78147cc4),

Stop chasing the "real writer" myth.

If you have helped, inspired, or made someone take any form of action with your words, that's real writing. It doesn't matter if it's a Tweet, a blog post, or a 70,000-word work of fiction. Because all writing that moves someone is real. Period.
