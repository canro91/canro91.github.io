A bit of nostalgia, reflection, and compilation today.

This is what happened, not today, but around this day in my blog:

Last year, before [being laid off]({% post_url 2024-12-05-HowALayoffFeels %}), I had just finished another short project with a contracting client. It was a project to support events, like weddings and conferences, in a hotel management software. That project taught me more about leadership and project management than coding. I wrote [two lessons I learned from that project]({% post_url 2024-02-05-LessonsOnAFinishedProject %}).

In 2023, I started a 4-part series on NullReferenceException with a post about [when NullReferenceException is thrown and how to avoid it]({% post_url 2023-02-20-WhatNullReferenceExceptionIs %}).

In 2022, I was still running Monday Links here. I wrote about [Daily Meetings, Estimates, and Challenges]({% post_url 2022-02-14-MondayLinks %}). From that episode, I included a post I found with 5 signs to look for when it's time to quit your job.

By the way, these days, I'm not running Monday Links, but Friday Links on an email list. Every Friday, you'll get a 2-minute email with curated resources about programming and software engineering. [Join here](https://fridaylinks.beehiiv.com/subscribe).

In 2021, I was working with a Stripe-powered payment processor. And I wrote about how to use [the Decorator pattern]({% post_url 2021-02-10-DecoratorPattern %}) to implement retry logic when sending payments to Stripe. The analogy I used to explain the Decorator pattern was IronMan wearing the HULKBUSTER suit.

In 2020, I used [the Pipeline pattern]({% post_url 2020-02-14-PipelinePattern %}) to create a pipeline of steps to make reservations. And since I had already used it to create invoices and notes in an invoicing system, I decided to write about it.

In 2019 and 2018, I didn't write in February. It's a shame. Well, I was still trying to find my rhythm and what to write about.
