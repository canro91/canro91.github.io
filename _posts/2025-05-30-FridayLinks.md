Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. This is not the first time we developers are being "replaced." [There's a recurring cycle of hype](https://alonso.network/the-recurring-cycle-of-developer-replacement-hype/) (6min). No code, the cloud, outsourcing, and these days AI. You name it!

#2. Here's a breakdown of [what every job title truly means](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/05/software-engineering-job-titles/) (6min). I plead guilty of using _Senior [Insert Technology here] Developer._ 

#3. Don't be discouraged about "Haskell" in the title. Here are some [silly job interview questions](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/interview) (15min). It's a good exercise trying to reimplement them in your favorite language, using a more "functional" approach.

#4. Starting from .NET10, we don't need a solution or project file to run C# programs. We can simply run `dotnet run app.cs` Here's [the official announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-run-app/) (5min).

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [six techniques to learn any skill faster]({% post_url 2025-05-27-SkipTheLine %}) (5min) and [why free pizzas aren't a good idea to motivate a team]({% post_url 2025-05-29-Pizzas %}) (2min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... Want to make your SQL Server go faster? Brent Ozar's special anniversary sale is almost over. Only two days left.

Until May 31st, get the [prerecorded Mastering bundle](https://training.brentozar.com/p/recorded-class-season-pass-masters-classes?affcode=920087_fhe3khrq) and save $400. This bundle includes four advanced courses covering indexes, queries, parameter sniffing, and full database optimization. SQL Server was my kryptonite until I learned databases from Brent's courses, and I highly recommend them. Grab the bundle before the sale ends.

See you next time,

Cesar
