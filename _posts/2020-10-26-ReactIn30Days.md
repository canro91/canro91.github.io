Do you want to learn React and you don't where to start? Don't look for any other curated list of resources. _Let's React._

React is an user-interface library. It doesn't do a lot of things. It renders elements. Period. React isn't a Swiss-army knife framework full of functionalities. From [2020 StackOverflow developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-web-frameworks), React is the second most popular Web Framework. 

> _"React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces"_ [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)

One of my takeaways from the [Ultralearning book](https://canro91.github.io/2020/07/14/UltralearningTakeaways/) is you should learn a new skill in the context where that skill will be applied. So, it's better to learn by doing, instead of reading a book from cover to cover or passively watching videos. _No copy and paste!_

### React & Redux

Redux could be the most challenging subject. _store, actions, reducers, thunks, sagas, dispatching_. Start by learning how to use `useState` hook, then `useReducer`, then `useContext`, and last Redux. It feels more natural this way.

Make sure to understand what to put into Redux store and where you should call your API calls. Be aware [you might not need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)
