I almost broke my daily writing habit today.

Starting on November 1st, I began writing daily here on my blog. I chose to go with a good headline and one main idea. That's good enough to mark the calendar and call it a day. No need for an introduction, 10 main points, and a conclusion.

I start my writing sessions after sitting in silence for 10 minutes with my eyes closed. Like magic, before finishing those 10 minutes, something comes to mind.

That was not the case today.

I looked at Hacker News, searching for something to react to but found nothing interesting. Reddit? Nothing. Old posts to expand on? Nothing. List of drafts? Extra nothing.

Until I had to step outside for a while.

There's something magical and mysterious about taking a walk... Well, there's nothing magical about that. More oxygen gets to the brain, and that activates certain brain regions.

On my way back home, I had something to write. I rushed to my laptop before I forgot it.

If you think you're facing writer's block, read something to prime your brain and step away from your computer for a walk. Before you get back, you'll have something to write. It works every time.
