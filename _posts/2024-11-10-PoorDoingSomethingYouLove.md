That's a quote I found last week while watching a conversation between Tom Bilyeu and Rich Roll [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prlqWU54NME). They were discussing Tom's mindset changes and work history.

That quote is an invitation to reflect what we're willing to give up in exchange for money.

It reflects what I've been going through since last year.

In 2023, I hit rock-bottom. But it wasn't a money thing. In fact, I was making the most money I had made in my career as a software engineer.

Things were good until they weren't.

I woke up and didn't feel the drive to show up to work. I wasn't learning and having fun. I was just for the money.

Every Sunday evening I felt anxious anticipating next Monday routine. Another daily meeting, another JIRA ticket, another Pull Request...Arrggg!

I knew I needed to do something but I was too comfortable and afraid of taking risks. I tried to control things around me. And I failed at that.

All my frustration lead to anger and resentment. It made sick literally.

That's why when I was "let go" at the begging of 2024, I felt relieved.

I was scared of making a change by myself. And life, God, or the Universe gave me a little "push."

I was fortunate to have enough "f*ck-you" money to finance my living expenses all these months.

Now, I'm reinventing my career.

I'm taking care of my health. I read and write. I've been recording some coding courses and doing some freelancing on the side.

I haven't figured out everything yet. I need a way to make money more consistently. I need to refill my "f*ck-you" money pockets. I don't know when I will need them again.

Definitely, Mondays are not the same when you wake up to do something you love.
