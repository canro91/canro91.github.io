I was supposed to unplug during the holidays.

But I decided to pick an easy project. I'm revamping [Unit Testing 101](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/unittesting101/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=real-sign-writing-improving), the first book I wrote. I called it an ebook because "book" felt too big a deal. Back then, I was even scared to put a price tag on it.

After finishing [Street-Smart Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=real-sign-writing-improving), my first "official" release, I wanted Unit Testing 101 to match that standard: editing, formatting, and a stronger cover.

Today I opened the draft in Google Docs and realized I'd structure chapters more clearly, tighten explanations, and reduce duplicated concepts.

If you cringe at your past work and think, "I'd do it way better now," that's the clearest sign you've grown.
