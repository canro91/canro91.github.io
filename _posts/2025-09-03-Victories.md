title: "I'm Bragging About a LinkedIn Recommendation That Made My Day"

I don't trust most LinkedIn recommendations.

You can ask a friend or a coworker to say good things about you. And who would showcase bad comments for future employers to see? Nobody!

But, but... Today I got a LinkedIn recommendation I didn't ask for. A reader/follower wrote this recommendation:

> _After reading his blog on SQL I connected with Cesar on LinkedIn , and his posts stood out for their clarity, honesty, and practical lessons. He has a ability to take real-world experiences in software engineering and turn them into valuable insights that others can learn from._
>
> _When I reached out with a career-related question, Cesar didn’t just give me a quick reply, he went the extra mile and even wrote a full article to share his perspective. That generosity and willingness to help reflect the kind of person and communicator he is. Cesar’s writing and guidance have had a direct impact on the way I think about coding, career growth, and opportunities._
>
> _I highly recommend Cesar for his exceptional writing, storytelling, and mentorship. He not only shares knowledge but also inspires others to take action and define their own paths._

It's great to read that my words have inspired and impacted someone's career. It means [my writing has done its job]({% post_url 2025-08-26-RealWriting %}).

Trying to hit the 300-post mark made me question if I should keep blogging. But that was a confirmation to keep doing it, even when it feels nobody is reading.

That recommendation made my day. And that's another screenshot I'm adding to [my "wins" folder]({% post_url 2025-07-02-Victories %}).
