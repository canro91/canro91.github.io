That's question I found on [dev.to](https://dev.to/m_midas/did-you-have-a-mentor-and-did-it-help-you-55pd). Here's my full answer:

I've had mentors. But, not formally and without the label.

I can pinpoint two or three people in my career that were like "mentors."

At a past job, I had the chance to work next to my team architects and learned a lot from them. From the value of reading other people's code to rejecting requests politely. [Here are some of those lessons]({% post_url 2022-12-18-LessonsFromExCoworkers %}).

And at another job, one day I decided to reach out to my boss' boss with genuine questions, not related to the job. He was open and kind enough to answer them. He liked reading books too and we connected on that. From that point, we started to have 1-1s outside the usual meetings. He recommended me a long list of books.

If you're looking for a mentor, don't ask anyone to "be your mentor." That would imply commitment from one side. Most of the time, for free.

Instead of asking someone "to be your mentor":

* Approach him with genuine questions
* Show interest in him
* Help him somehow too
* Show you're taking action on the advice or input you're given

Don't worry if you don't have a mentor or can't find one.

Mentors are everywhere. The good thing is you don't have to meet them. 200-500 books are a good mentor. I learned that from [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}), a mentor I haven't met.
