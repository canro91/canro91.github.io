title: "Content Ideas Are Already There, You Just Need to Search for Them"

"Money has already been made, we just have to get out and search for it."

That's a common phrase in my hometown. It means money rewards action. And like I learned from hearing and watching James Altucher, nobody wakes up and thinks about giving money to any of us. We have to search for it.

That applies to content ideas too. Replace "money" with "content" and you'll get the same meaning.

When we wear our writer (or creative) glasses, there's content everywhere:
* Books
* Questions
* Conversations
* Emails you reply to
* Projects you're working on
* Comments you leave on social media
* Other people's posts
* Situations at work
* TV shows

Everywhere.

For example, the other day I realized the same coworker had asked the same question about investing on a WhatsApp group. [Then I wrote about it]({% post_url 2024-11-07-CompaniesToBuy %}).

Another coworker asked me how to start writing on LinkedIn. [Then I wrote about it]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}).

Another day I was reading a book review. And I realized I had read the same book. I stopped reading and [wrote my own review]({% post_url 2024-11-29-ReadingMore %}).

Another day I found a post I didn't agree with. [Then I wrote a reaction]({% post_url 2024-11-14-NoNulIsAGoodIdea %}).

I felt guilty for binge-watching my favorite TV shows until I started to write about them. Now watching Netflix and TV shows is an excuse to write more content. Content is everywhere.
