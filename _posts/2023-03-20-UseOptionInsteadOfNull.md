In the [previous post of this series]({% post_url 2023-03-06-NullableOperatorsAndReferences %}), we covered three C# operators to simplify null checks and C# 8.0 Nullable References to signal when things can be `null`. In this post, let's learn a more "functional" approach to removing `null` and how to use it to avoid `null` when working with LINQ `XOrDefault` methods.

## 1. Use Option: A More Functional Approach to Nulls

Functional languages like F# or Haskell use a different approach for `null` and optional values. Instead of `null`, they use an `Option` or `Maybe` type.

With the `Option` type, we have a "box" that might have a value or not. It's the same concept of nullable ints, for example. I bet you have already used them. Let's see an example,

```csharp
int? maybeAnInt = null;

var hasValue = maybeAnInt.HasValue;
// false

var dangerousInt = maybeAnInt.Value;
//                            ^^^^^
// Nullable object must have a value.

var safeInt = maybeAnInt.GetValueOrDefault();
// 0
```

With nullable ints, we have variable that either holds an interger or `null`. They have the `HasValue` and `Value` properties, and the `GetValueOrDefault()` method to access their inner value.

We can extend the concept of a box with possibly a value to reference types with the `Option` type. We can wrap our reference types like `Option<int>` or `Option<Movie>`.

### The Option Type

The `Option` type has two subtypes: `Some` and `None`. `Some` represents a box with a value inside it, and `None`, an empty box.

The `Option` has two basic methods:
1. One method to put something into a box. Often we call it `Unit`. For this, we can use the constructor of `Some` and `None`.
2. One method to open the box, transform its value and return a new one with the result. Let's call this method `Map`.

{% include image.html name="UnitAndMap.png" alt="Option Unit and Map functions" caption="Option's Unit and Map functions" width="600px" %}

Let's use the [Optional library](https://github.com/nlkl/Optional), _a robust option type for C#_, to see how to use the `Some`, `None`, and `Map()`,

```csharp
using Optional;

Option<int> someInt = Option.Some(42);
Option<int> none = Option.None<int>();

var doubleOfSomeInt = someInt.Map(value => value * 2)
                             .ValueOr(-1);
// 84

var doubleOfNone = none.Map(value => value * 2)
                       .ValueOr(-1);
// -1
```

We created two optional ints: `someInt` and `none`. Then, we used `Map()` to double their values. Then, to retrieve the value of each optional, we used `ValueOr()` with a default value.

For `someInt`, `Map()` returned another optional with the double of 42 and `ValueOr()` returned the same result. And for `none`, `Map()` returned `None` and `ValueOr()` returned -1.

### How to Flatten Nested Options

Now, let's rewrite the `HttpContext` example from previous posts,

```csharp
public class HttpContext
{
    public static Option<HttpContext> Current;
    //            ^^^^^

    public HttpContext()
    {
    }

    public Option<Request> Request { get; set; }
    //     ^^^^^
}

public record Request(Option<string> ApplicationPath);
//                    ^^^^^
```

Notice that instead of appending `?` to type declarations like what we did with in the past post when we covered [C# 8.0 Nullable References]({% post_url 2023-03-06-NullableOperatorsAndReferences %}), we wrapped them around `Option`.

This time, `Current` is a box with `Request` as another box inside. And `Request` has the `ApplicationPath` as another box.

Now, let's retrieve the `ApplicationPath`,

```csharp
var path = HttpContext.Current
            .FlatMap(current => current.Request)
            // ^^^^^
            .FlatMap(request => request.ApplicationPath)
            // ^^^^^
            .ValueOr("/some-default-path-here");
            // ^^^^
            // Or
            //.Match((path) => path , () => "/some-default-path-here");

// This isn't the real HttpContext class...
// We're writing some dummy declarations to prove a point
public class HttpContext
{
    public static Option<HttpContext> Current;

    public HttpContext()
    {
    }

    public Option<Request> Request { get; set; }
}

public record Request(Option<string> ApplicationPath);
```

To get the `ApplicationPath` value, we had to open all boxes that contain it. For that, we used the `FlatMap()` method. It grabs the value in the box, transforms it, and returns another box. With `FlatMap()`, we can flatten two nested boxes.

{% include image.html name="FlatMap.png" alt="Option FlatMap function" caption="Option's FlatMap to flatten nested options" width="600px" %}

Notice we didn't do any transformation with `FlatMap()`. We only retrieved the inner value of `Option`, which was already another `Option`.

This is how we read `ApplicationPath`:

1. With `FlatMap()`, we opened the `Current` box and grabbed the `Request` box in it.
2. Then, we used `FlatMap()` again to open `Request` and grab the `ApplicationPath`.
3. Finally, with `ValueOr()`, we took out the value inside `ApplicationPath` if it had any. Otherwise, if the `ApplicationPath` was empty, it returned a default value of our choice.

"This is the way!" Sorry, this is the "functional" way! We can think of nullable ints like ints being wrapped around a `Nullable` box with more compact syntax and some helper methods.

## 2. Option and LINQ XOrDefault methods

Another source of NullReferenceException is when we don't check the result of the `FirstOrDefault`, `LastOrDefault`, and `SingleOrDefault` methods. These methods return `null` when the source collection has reference types, and there are no matching elements. In fact, this is one of the [most common mistakes when working with LINQ]({% post_url 2022-06-13-LinqMistakes %}).

There are some alternatives to prevent the NullReferenceException when working with `XOrDefault` methods. 

[.NET 6.0 released some new LINQ methods and overloads]({% post_url 2022-06-27-NET6LinqMethods %}). With .NET 6.0, we can use a second parameter with the `XOrDefault` methods to pass a default value of our choice. Also, we can use [the DefaultIfEmpty method]({% post_url 2020-11-17-DefaultOrEmpty %}) instead of filtering collections with `FirstOrDefault`.

### Use Optional's XOrNone

But, let's combine the `XOrDefault` methods with the `Option` type. We can make the `XOrDefault` methods return an `Option<T>` instead of `null`.

The Optional library has `FirstOrNone()`, `LastOrNone()` and `SingleOrNone()` instead of the usual `XOrDefault` methods.

This time, let's use `FirstOrNone()` instead of `FirstOrDefault()`,

```csharp
using Optional.Collections;
//    ^^^^^

var movies = new List<Movie>
{
    new Movie("Shrek", 2001, 3.95f),
    new Movie("Inside Out", 2015, 4.1f),
    new Movie("Ratatouille", 2007, 4f),
    new Movie("Toy Story", 1995, 4.1f),
    new Movie("Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs", 2009, 3.75f)
};

var theBestOfAll = new Movie("My Neighbor Totoro", 1988, 5);

// With .NET FirstOrDefault()
var theBest = movies.FirstOrDefault(
                    movie => movie.Rating == 5.0,
                    theBestOfAll);
                    // ^^^^^

// With Optional's FirstOrNone()
var theBestAgain = movies.FirstOrNone(movie => movie.Rating == 5.0)
                    //    ^^^^^
                    .ValueOr(theBestOfAll);
                    // ^^^^^
Console.WriteLine(theBestAgain.Name);

record Movie(string Name, int ReleaseYear, float Rating);
```

By using the `XOrNone` methods, we're forced to check if they return something before trying to use their result.

Voil√†! That's the functional way of doing `null`, with the Option or Maybe type. Here we used the Optional library, but there's also another library I like: [Optuple](https://github.com/atifaziz/Optuple). It uses the tuple `(bool HasValue, T Value)` to represent the `Some` and `None` subtypes.

Even though we used a library to bring the Option type, we can implement our own `Option` type and its methods. It's not that difficult. We need an abstract class with two child classes and a couple of extension methods to make it work.
