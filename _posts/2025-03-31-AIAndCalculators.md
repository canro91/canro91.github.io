title: "Use AI Like We Use Calculators in Math"

For 8 years, calculators are banned in math class.

We can only use calculators after we learn to do arithmetic by hand, like multiplying and dividing 2- and 3-figure numbers manually. We have to learn the procedure first.

We should use AI the same way, only after we know how to do the procedure by hand.

If you aren't comfortable with coding yet, [don't ask AI to generate code]({% post_url 2025-03-24-NewCodersAndAI %}).

If you aren't comfortable with writing, don't ask AI to generate any text. Instead, [use it to proofread]({% post_url 2025-03-01-ReplacingGrammarly %}) and critique your writing.

AI should be like calculators in math: a tool to make us faster if we know what we're doing. They can't do the thinking part for us. That's still on us.
