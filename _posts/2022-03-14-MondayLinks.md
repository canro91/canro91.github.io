## 11 things I wish I knew before I went Independent

A good read for all of us wanting to go solo. The author answers the question: _"how you made the decision to go independent and how you got started?"_. Among other things: find a niche, learn about sales and marketing, and talk to your customers... Definitively we don't have to be the "I do anything for anyone" kind of guys.

## How to build remote teams properly

I remember my first day at one past job. I spent like one week going to the office and doing nothing. I couldn't even touch a computer until someone, who was on vacation, showed me all the security policies.

A clear onboarding is much more important these days of work-from-home than before. Have a standardized onboarding process and assign a buddy to the newcomers. Onboarding is only one step to building remote teams. [Read full article](https://vadimkravcenko.com/en/how-to-build-remote-teams-properly/)

## This Is How To Make Friends As An Adult

Let's switch gears for this one. Speaking of being adults and making friends..._"being 'close' means a text message twice a year."_ That got me reading. Reconnect with old friends, listen to people and ask them to tell more, check in every two weeks, and join a group.

## Why I Decided to Ditch AutoMapper

This is an oldie. I have a love-and-hate relationship with AutoMapper. I can't debug and easily find where the mappings are. Maybe, because in one of my client's projects we use AutoMapper when we shouldn't.
