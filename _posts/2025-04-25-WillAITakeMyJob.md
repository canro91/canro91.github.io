Anita asked on [dev.to](https://dev.to/anitaolsen/will-ai-take-my-job-1ap0) if AI, given all the hype, will take her job.

Short answer: Not yet.

Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.

Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
* Inter-team planning
* Brainstorming sessions
* Putting late sprints back on track
* Designing requirements and user stories
* Decomposing a full project into milestones
* Scoping tasks with Product people
* Reviewing architecture designs
* Negotiating deadlines
* Talking to clients

And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.

But sure, [our job as coders will change]({% post_url 2024-04-29-2034Predictions %}). Even [if we're skeptical about AI]({% post_url 2025-02-24-AVeteranOnAI %}), we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. [We have to adapt]({% post_url 2025-01-21-AIAdaptation %}).

We won't be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.
