You don't need X-ray vision, super strength, or any other superpower to save lives.

Recently, I read about [James Harrison's story](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5316163/james-harrison-blood-donor), an Australian called the "Man with the Golden Arm." His blood had a rare antibody used to treat a disease in pregnant women. He saved over 2 million babies, his own grandkids included.

A true hero without any superpowers. Well, a hero with super blood.

One family member, for health issues, has received blood transfusions at least three times in recent years. She has received 8 "units" in total. This means 4 heroes have saved her life. Since then, I've decided to donate enough to at least match the units she has received.

James was a hero for millions of babies. Some heroes saved my loved one. Inspired by them, I decided to become a hero for someone else too.

Forget about the red cape and boots, you don't need them to save lives. Donate blood and be someone's hero.
