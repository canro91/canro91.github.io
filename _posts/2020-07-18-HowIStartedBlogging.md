## Once upon a time, a junior engineer at his first job

Everything started on my first professional job. I was a junior software engineer, the least experienced on the team. I had just finished reading [The Clean Code]({% post_url 2020-01-06-CleanCodeReview %}). I wanted to rewrite all the code I had worked with.

I had a lot to share with my colleagues about coding. But I was  the new guy. So I came up with “Daily Tips”. It was a weekly email with a single tip about how to write better code. Those tips came from what I had seen on the book and on the code I worked with. For example, use boolean  variables instead of integers for flags. I started to accumulate some of  these tips on my computer. These tips ended up on my presentations for  newcomers at my next job.

## The first post

The real starting point was a few years later on my second job.  After getting tired of writing log statements to chase down bugs, I went  to the Internet to see what was out there. “There’s must be a better way!”.

I found Fody, a solution using Aspect Oriented Programming. I put up a  proof of concept and showed it to my team lead. Unfortunately, that proof of concept didn’t  get into the codebase. But I had my findings. I didn’t want to lose  that time and that how-to behind an unread email. My blog and its first  post was born.

## Next posts

After that, I started to write about the bugs that literally gave me  headaches, the resources I used to learn languages and frameworks, the  notes from the books I read. I started to share my learning and my  experiences. And here you are, 30 posts after that first post.

## Your turn

You don't need to wait to be a well-known figure in the tech field to have a blog.

A blog is a mean to share your learning. To learn in  public. To share your insights. To [show your work]({% post_url 2020-10-01-ShowYourWorkTakeaways %}). That will make your blog unique.

I don't have anything to write about?-you said. Have you learned something new? Share that. Share the resources you used to learned it.

Probably, next time you're Googling something, you will find your own blog posts.
