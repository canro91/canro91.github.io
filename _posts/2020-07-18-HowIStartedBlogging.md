### _Once upon a time, a junior engineer at his first job_

Everything started on my first professional job. I was a junior  software engineer, the least experienced on the team. I just finished  reading “The Clean Code”. I wanted to rewrite all the code I worked  with. I had a lot to shared with my colleagues about coding. But I was  the new guy. So I came up with “Daily Tips”. It was a weekly email with a  single tip about how to write better code. Those tips came from what I had seen on  the book and on the code I worked with. For example, use boolean  variables instead of integers for flags. I started to accumulate some of  these tips on my computer. These tips ended up on my presentations for  newcomers at my next job.

### _The first post_

But, the real starting point was a few years later on my second job.  After getting tired of writing log statements to chase down bugs, I went  to the Internet to see what was out there. “There’s must be a better way!”  I found Fody, a solution using Aspect Oriented Programming. I put up a  proof of concept and showed it to my team lead. Unfortunately, it didn’t  get into the codebase. But I had my findings. I didn’t want to lose  that time and that how-to behind an unread email. My blog and its first  post was born.

### _Next posts_

After that, I started to write about the bugs that literally gave me  headaches, the resources I used to learn languages and frameworks, the  notes from the books I read. I started to share my learning and my  experiences. And here you are, 30 posts after that first post.

You don’t need to wait to be a well-known figure in the tech field to  have a blog. A blog is a mean to share your learning. To learn in  public. To share your insights. That will make your blog unique.
