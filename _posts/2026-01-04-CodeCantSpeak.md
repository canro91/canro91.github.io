Good code won't save your career.

For so long, I chased perfectly clean code, thinking better code = better cod-er. That turned me into a clean code cop, looking for infractions around me. [It got me fired]({% post_url 2025-01-14-BeingFired %}).

Focusing on syntax alone was [my biggest mistake as a new coder]({% post_url 2025-10-21-BiggestMistake %}).

## Why code isn't enough

Two experiences taught me good code isn't what mattered most.

At a past job, when the team leader left, [the one promoted wasn't the best coder]({% post_url 2024-12-01-WhoGetsPromoted %}). It was the one who showed initiative to own the core feature.

Then during layoffs, I talked to a leader from another team. He was told to sort people into buckets: A, B, and C. Bucket C left first, then B, then A. The criteria wasn't perfect code. It was whether the leader wanted you on the team. Of course, the ones writing horrible code got into the C crowd first.

It was always something else besides coding.

## Your code can't speak.

Addy Osmani, a leader at Google, shares why you need more than code to stand out.

Get good at coding to stand out. No doubt!

But your code won't speak for you.

Here's what will:
* Asking the right questions in meetings.
* Working on something that brings (or saves) money.
* Sharing your achievements after every project.
* Being responsible for a feature from end to end.
* Being the team member everyone wants to work with.

People won't remember your code. They will remember your attitude.

That's why I wrote _Street-Smart Coding,_ the roadmap I wish I had starting out to grow and stand out as a coder.
