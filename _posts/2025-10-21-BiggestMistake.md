"Focus on one thing," a coworker used to tell me. But I didn't listen.

I was in my first job about 10 years ago. I was learning C#, catching up with PHP, and reading about Python. I remember going through Hangfire documentation without knowing how I'd use it.

Like most new coders, I suffered from [shiny object syndrome]({% post_url 2025-01-30-ChasingShinyObjects %}).

## I was focused only on mastering syntax

At that time, for me coding was only about syntax, symbols, and languages.

One day, my boss called me to his office and I arrived late because I was "coding." He lectured me that day. And I deserved it. Looking back, I'm surprised I didn't get into more trouble.

And to make things worse, I picked [Clean Code]({% post_url 2020-01-06-CleanCodeReview %}). By the time I finished it, I had become a Clean Code cop. I started to look for violations around me. Every piece of code had to follow the book.

Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

## The hard lesson: Coding isn't only about syntax

Yes, coding is about syntax. But it's more than just typing symbols.

Most coding happens away from a keyboard: in meetings, brainstorming sessions, and on whiteboards. You'll spend a lot of time [talking to non-tech people]({% post_url 2024-11-15-TalkingToNonTechies %}), negotiating deadlines, and managing change.

Junior me didn't know that. And by trial and error, I had to learn the lesson. [Getting fired]({% post_url 2025-01-14-BeingFired %}) was part of it.

Learning more languages will grow your toolbox, but it won't necessarily make you a well-rounded coder. Work on your collaboration, [clear communication]({% post_url 2025-07-14-CommAtWork %}), and [writing]({% post_url 2024-11-08-WhyWriting %}) skills too.

I wish someone had told me that when I started out. And that's why I wrote _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding._ Because coding is more than typing symbols fast.
