Inspired by [a Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46937696), here's what I'm working on:

**#1. My health:** After falling ill in 2023-2024, I began caring daily for my body, mind, and spirit daily, and more recently, for my eating habits.

**#2. Less phone time:** With about 2 hours of average screen time per day, I'm working to [reduce my phone time]({% post_url 2026-01-22-LessScrolling %}) and [embrace boredom]({% post_url 2026-02-03-Boredom %}).

**#3. A book trilogy:** Before retiring from coding, I'm leaving all my lessons in books. My plan is to write a trilogy. I already wrote [Street-Smart Coding]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}). That's a roadmap of coding skills. The first I wrote, but the second in the trilogy.

**#4. A book experiment:** This month, I'm running [a book experiment]({% post_url 2026-02-01-BookExperiment %}).

I'm turning my most popular post about personal development into a short, actionable guide. My goal is to finish it in one month. I've made good progress on the first draft, even [handwriting some chapters]({% post_url 2026-02-07-Handwriting %}).

**#5. Daily writing:** Last year, I hit [the 400th daily post]({% post_url 2025-12-06-400DailyPosts %}).

I began on [November 1, 2024]({% post_url 2024-11-01-SellingVsHelping %}), during a forced sabbatical after a layoff.

I've considered abandoning daily writing or limiting it to workdays. But after a ban from a social blog, I'm doubling down on my blog and email list.
