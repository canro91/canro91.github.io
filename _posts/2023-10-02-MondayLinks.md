One conference and four articles I found interesting in the last month.

## CQRS pitfalls and patterns - Udi Dahan

I share the points from this presentation about overarchitecting simple applications when there isn't a compelying reason for that. I've witnessed developers and managers using and promoting Domain Driven Design as the golden hammer to write all aplications, even simple CRUD-like ones. The speaker shares that eventually-consistent CQRS is not for that type of applications.

Althought this talk might seem about coding, it's more about bussiness and designing software.

## Trying to become a better developer by learning more about aviation

I have always been intrigued by planes. We started from the Wright brothers to planes flying by themselves. I have always been interested by software, procedures, and processes that keep planes in the air.

We, as software engineers, have a lot to learn from pilots. For example, "Aviate, Navigate, Communicate" is one of the principles pilots follow during incidents. Their number one priority is keeping the plane flying. We could take that principle to the software engineering world.

## How to sabotage your salary negotiations efforts before you even start

Interviewing is another skill to master by itself. One thing I've found everywhere online is never say a number first. This article shows common mistakes and sample scripts when negotiating salaries.

## Lessons learned as a software developer turned project manager

I really liked this one! I've been in teams where project managers have no idea about building software and they only focus on running meetings and other "ceremonies." I wish all project managers in software companies had a development background. I know I'm asking for the moon.

Some quotes from this article:

* _"the most difficult challenge in a technical project is the communication between parties"_
* _"the scope of the project and what needs to be done should be clear to everyone"_
* _"don't ever, ever, call your colleagues or developers resources or FTE's (full time equivalent), they're humans, not beans"_

## How To Opt Out Of The Career Ladder

If you don't believe in the career ladder, this one is for you. It contains a questionnaire to help taking the first steps into a different path. _"being clear with yourself on what role you actually want work to play in your life is an important foundational step to exploring what’s next"_

Voilà! Another Monday Links. Have you seen developers switching to project management too? Do you have any tips to negotiate salaries? Until next Monday Links.
