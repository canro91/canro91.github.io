[A recent podcast interview]({% post_url 2025-09-11-ALXSept2025 %}) was the perfect excuse to ask for feedback on my interviewing skills.

I've been putting more attention on [my communication skills]({% post_url 2025-07-14-CommAtWork %}), but never asked for feedback. So I reached out to [Ryan Alexander Wiens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-wiens/), a coach who helps engineers speak clearly and show impact, showing him one of my answers.

Here are two suggestions Ryan gave me. I'm sure he doesn't mind I'm sharing them here:

**#1. Slow down at key words and pause for emphasis.** It's hard to sound confident while answering well. Pauses give us time to think and create a sense of expectation for the listeners.

**#2. Answer with PREP: Point/Reason/Example/Point.** To answer questions confidently, I learned to start and end with the main point.

But to make our answers more impactful, add a "Why" or a reason after the main point. Then to end the answer, restate the question with the main point again. We tend to remember only the beginning and end, so win-win! We look more confident and help the listener remember our answer.

So let's say we're asked about the mistakes beginners make in terms of branding. Following the 4-step framework we could say:

> (Point) I'd say one of my biggest mistakes has been <pause> not to start earlier. <pause> 
>
> (Reason) Building a brand has brought me great opportunities, like this interview... I wish I had started sooner.
>
> (Example) If I had to start right from scratch again, I'd... 
>
> (Point) That was my mistake and the mistake most beginners make: waiting too long to start. 

Now thanks to Ryan's PREP framework, you're PREPared for your next podcast or job interview. Pun intended.
