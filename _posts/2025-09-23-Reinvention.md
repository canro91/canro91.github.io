Today, I found a post promising an "upgraded" roadmap for growth in life.

I found it in a LinkedIn post. I know. [LinkedIn is a weird place]({% post_url 2025-07-27-LinkedInWeirdness %}). Full of shallow advice and "see my perfect routine" posts. I'm not sure which category this post belongs in. I won't link to it.

It showed a comparison between the outdated and the upgraded roadmaps for growth.

The outdated roadmap was to find a job, work for 40 years, and retire. I completely agree. [I wish I had learned that lesson 10 years ago]({% post_url 2025-05-07-LifeLesson %}). But the first step in the upgraded roadmap was to "Get clear on your goals in life." Easier said than done!

How do we "get clear on our goals"? Figuring out what we want in life is hard.

## An easier start on the upgraded roadmap

Last year, [I was burned out]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}) and I was laid off.

The corporate world disappointed me. It squeezed all the passion I had until the very last drop. I was so lost that imagining a new life felt impossible.

I still don't know what I want in life. Maybe just waking up energized to work on something I love and [being content and present]({% post_url 2025-08-11-Present %}) every day.

But what helped me recover from burnout and "get clear in life" was to focus on my physical and mental health. I didn't know what to do next. No career plan, no new job. I only knew I didn't want to stay the same.

My reinvention phase started with a YouTube workout session, writing 200 words, and a moment of silence every day... And reading books from people who had gone through something similar, like Borja Vilaseca and [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}).

James' books taught me that we don't need a master goal or passion, whatever that means, to reinvent ourselves. We already have one goal, one passion: taking care of ourselves. That's an easy place to start and maybe the most important one.
