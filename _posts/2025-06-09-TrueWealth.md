What does being wealthy truly mean?

Yesterday, before starting 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, I watched [a YouTube interview with Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hc6TNV6F-g) about that book. That was part of [my new reading strategy]({% post_url 2025-01-09-ReadingStrategy %}). Authors often go on podcast tours to promote their books, sharing their insights and the intentions behind their books.

Towards the end, the interview closed with this unexpected idea:

> _"If you're important, you don't have a phone. If you work for somebody else, you have a phone"_

That was shocking but eye-opening. The point isn't about owning a phone per se but about having full control of our time. A phone means your boss might interrupt you with any apparent urgent issue.

That line hit really hard. It was only after a layoff that I realized I felt the pressure of always being available and responding to messages. [I didn't know how a salary had messed with my mind]({% post_url 2024-12-21-MessySalary %}).

True wealth isn't measured in currency, but in the ability to own our time. And I need to dump my phone.
