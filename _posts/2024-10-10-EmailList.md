Bye, Monday Links. Hello, Friday Links.

For months, I ran a series called: [Monday Links](/tags/mondaylinks/). Every time I found interesting posts about programming and software engineering, I compiled them until I had five or six and then published them in a post.

It was a way to document what I read and react to the other people's posts, when my reaction didn't merit a separate post. Think of Twitter/X threads on my blog.

I'm moving my Monday Links to an email list.

The format is almost the same. Every Friday, I send five posts about software engineering and programming. But I sprinkle other interesting subjects in between. Also, I include one of my own posts published the same week and share updates about the projects I'm creating.

For example, here's [Monday Links on Notebooks, Learning, and KPIs]({% post_url 2024-02-19-MondayLinks %}), the last Monday Link I wrote here.

If you have already downloaded any of my ebooks from <a href="https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Gumroad page</a>, you're already receiving my emails.

But if you haven't and want to receive them, <a href="https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/fridaylinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subscribe here</a>.

Feel free to reply to my Friday Links and comment or ask questions.
