Two days ago, I decided it was time to [reduce my phone use]({% post_url 2026-01-22-LessScrolling %}).

I left books where I used to put my phone: desk, couch, and table. Instead of reaching for my phone, now I find myself opening _The Power of Now_ by Eckhart Tolle or _Jesus' Son_ by Dennis Johnson.

Yesterday, I paused on my way to my desk to grab my phone. Midway, I realized my phone wasn't there anymore. That's a habit being replaced.

Today, I thought carefully about when I needed my phone. And it was easier to read with books nearby. I even left it behind for a quick errand.

Big changes start with small actions. Mine began with swapping screens for pages.
