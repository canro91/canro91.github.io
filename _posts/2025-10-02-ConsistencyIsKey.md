title: "7 Fresh Alternatives to LinkedIn's Most Overused Cliché"

[Join the LinkedIn creator crowd]({% post_url 2025-06-15-LinkedIn %}) and you'll hear one tired phrase everywhere.

"Consistency is key."

One influencer said it, and everybody trying to sound smart repeated it. And now it's everywhere.

I roll my eyes every time I see it, [not because it's wrong]({% post_url 2024-12-14-Consistency %}), but because it's overused. It's the "synergies," "alignment," and "disruption." It's the corporate lingo nobody uses it in a real conversation.

I'm so sick of it, I had to rephrase it.

Here are my 7 alternatives to "Consistency is key:"
1. Don't break the posting chain
2. Show up as if your life depends on it
3. No successful brand was built in a day
4. Post until people recognize you from the feed
5. Show up until it becomes second nature
6. You only lose if you stop playing
7. Just keep doing it

I promise I won't say "Consistency is key" again. Because every time we say it, a cute baby panda dies in the forest. Let's save pandas by retiring this and other overused clichés for good.
