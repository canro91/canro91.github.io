#1. "I'm a simple man making his way through the galaxy, like my father before me"

If you're a Star Wars fan, you recognize that phrase. That's by Boba Fett from The Mandalorian.

We're all here trying to figure out our paths. Some are more intentional about it, others are not. Some have found it, others are still searching.

Every stage in life will bring its own challenges and paths to figure out.

#2. "The minute you learn something, teach it"

That's from [Show Your Work]({% post_url 2020-10-01-ShowYourWorkTakeaways %}) by Austen Kleon. "A book for people who hate the very idea of self promotion."

That phrase puts into words one of my core values.

It has kept my curious inner child alive. Once I find something new, my sense of curiosity or inner child, wants to share it with somebody else. Most of the time, by writing about it.

When you teach what you learn, you have the chance of learning it twice.
