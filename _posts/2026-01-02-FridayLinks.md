Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** One of my worst career mistakes was going on auto-pilot without a plan. I jumped from job to job until I got bored or fired. But [if you don't plan your career, someone else will](https://gregmckeown.com/if-you-dont-design-your-career-someone-else-will/) (4min).

**#2.** 2026 is the year to start a side project? Just find a focused time block. Maybe that's [coding on the subway](https://www.scd31.com/posts/programming-on-the-subway) (6min).

**#3.** A summary of [the state of AI at the end of 2025](https://antirez.com/news/157) (4min) by the Redis' creator.

**#4.** Holiday season is usually for reflection. If you haven't yet, try these [a 10-question](https://alearningaday.blog/2025/12/24/10-questions-annual-reflection-2025/) (4min) or [a 40-question prompts](https://github.com/kepano/40-questions/blob/master/year.md) (3min). I followed that last one.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [feeling AI FOMO]({% post_url 2025-12-28-AIFomo %}) (2min) and a [30-action digital decluttering plan]({% post_url 2025-12-29-Decluttering %}) (4min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... my new book, _Street-Smart Coding_: 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

Happy coding in 2026!

See you next time,

Cesar
