Hey, it's been a busy week. I've been preparing my last book for publish on Amazon, so I didn't read that much.

But I still want to share some interesting reads. Here are my top 3 most read posts from the quarter plus a funny weekend project.

**#1.** I always joke that I don't know when "Senior" made it into my job title. But I know it was thanks to good mentors. Here are [5 lessons from one of my mentors]({% post_url 2025-10-25-LessonsFromMentor %}) (4min). I've been following lesson #1 since I met him...Well, not in the past week.

**#2.** What's the first thing that comes to mind when you hear "get good at coding"? Younger me only thought about learning programming languages. But here are [7 unconventional ways to improve your coding skills]({% post_url 2025-10-26-GettingGood %}) (3min).

**#3.** I'd do a lot differently if I were a junior again. Here's [one lesson I wish I had known 10 years ago]({% post_url 2025-08-13-OneCodingLesson %}) (3min). That would have made me a well-rounded coder.

**#4.** What if we could slam a phone after a boring Zoom call? That was the side project of someone who [turned a rotary phone into a meeting handset](https://www.stavros.io/posts/i-converted-a-rotary-phone-into-a-meeting-handset/) (8min).

Speaking of coding, are you following the Advent of Code? I have. I missed a couple of days, but I'm catching up this weekend. Here's my last solution: [Advent of Code Day 6: Doing Cephalopods' Math](https://canro91.github.io/2025/12/10/AoC6/) (3min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... my new book, _Street-Smart Coding_: 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

See you next time,

Cesar
