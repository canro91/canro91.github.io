Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. I had ~5 meetings to decide what to do on each sprint. And I wasn't doing any rocket science, just boring enterprise software. Meetings are the #1 distraction and a necessary evil. Here's [how to create the ultimate meeting culture](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture) (8min).

#2. If you're a new manager or you want to become one, here's [a down-to-earth guide for new managers](https://scottkosman.com/post/blog/so-youre-a-manager-now/) (7min). I really liked the coach analogy.

#3. Here's another way [how AI is "killing" junior coders](https://www.gizvault.com/archives/the-lost-path-to-seniorhood) (4min) in the open source world.

#4. If you've ever wondered if you're a good programmer, [read this post/reflection](https://thecodist.com/what-is-a-good-programmer/). It helps with the impostor syndrome.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the business lesson I learned buying a new mattress]({% post_url 2025-07-30-BuyingAMattress %}) (2min) and [10 career actions you will never regret]({% post_url 2025-07-31-CareerRegrets %}) (2min).
