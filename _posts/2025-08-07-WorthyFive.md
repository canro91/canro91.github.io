While curating this week's [Friday Links](https://fridaylinks.beehiiv.com/subscribe) email, I found out about Dense Discovery and got inspired.

That newsletter features a section called Worthy Five where a subscriber shares 5 things worth watching, reading, asking...

So I'm stealing (like an artist) that idea, and tweaking it for new coders:

## #1. A video worth watching.

Well, it's more a lecture series. Watch Stanford CS106A [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMDCCdjyW8&list=PL84A56BC7F4A1F852).

That's an introductory course to programming. I watched all the lectures in the 2010s while learning to code. I loved the energy of the teacher and the exercises using video games to teach programming concepts.

Watch the first few lectures, you'll love it.

## #2. A question worth asking.

Ask what you want out of your career.

I jumped from job to job without any plan until I got bored or fired. At the end, [I burned out]({% post_url 2025-03-22-IsBurnoutInevitable %}) after trying to make a "good" job work for me. I never took the time to set an intention for my career.

Come up with a career plan or goal. Remember you can always change it.

## #3. A book worth reading.

OK, let me give you two.

First, [Clean Coder]({% post_url 2020-06-15-CleanCoder %}). I enjoyed this one more than Clean Code. Clean Coder isn't about writing code, but about being a professional developer. It covers professionalism, unit testing, and estimates.

The other one? Code That Fits Into Your Head. This isn't precisely a book on syntax, but rather one about programming practices. Its main point? Write code in such a way you can keep its details in your head.

If you don't know which one to pick first, go with Clean Coder.

## #4. An activity worth doing

Write!

I'm biased here. I love writing. But, seriously, write anywhere online. To [put your thoughts on paper]({% post_url 2024-11-08-WhyWriting %}). To document your learning.

Writing opens doors you can't even imagine. For example, [my blog has done more than a portfolio]({% post_url 2025-01-12-BlogVsPortfolio %}).

If you don't know how to start, [write TIL posts]({% post_url 2025-04-10-TilPosts %}).

## #5. A piece of advice worth passing on

Back at my first job, a coworker gave me this piece of advice:

> _Imagine you only make half of your salary, save and invest the other half._

Probably the best piece of advice I've received for free. Here are [another two I never asked]({% post_url 2025-06-29-BestAdvice %}). That one helped me survive a layoff. Definitely worth passing on.
