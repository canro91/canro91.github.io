Hey there.

Here are 4 links worth sharing this week:

**#1.** [Something big is already happening](https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening). AI may not be disrupting markets, like most CEOs claim. But it's definitely changing job descriptions. Saving is one step to prepare.

**#2.** Someday we will tell our grandkids that dad once wrote code by hand. We're the last in a generation of coders. [Now is the time to mourn our craft](https://nolanlawson.com/2026/02/07/we-mourn-our-craft/) (4min).

**#3.** [A fake 7-Zip download turned PCs into zombie machines](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intel/2026/02/fake-7-zip-downloads-are-turning-home-pcs-into-proxy-nodes) (10min). It all started with the wrong url. We're still the weakest link.

**#4.** Postman [from beloved API client to an "everything" app](https://codingismycraft.blog/index.php/2026/02/05/postman-from-api-client-to-everything-app/) (5min). It's become "a completely feature-creeped product."

And in case you missed it, I've been writing on my blog about [my social media free week]({% post_url 2026-02-15-NoFeeds %}) (1min). Here are my [day 1]({% post_url 2026-02-16-NoFeeds1 %}) (2min) and [day 2]({% post_url 2026-02-17-NoFeeds2 %}) (1min) updates. In the meantime, I've picked two books and worked on another book project. (This won't be about coding. More updates soon!)

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... _Street-Smart Coding,_ 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. From Googling to clear communication, it covers the lessons you don't learn in tutorials. It's now out on [Kindle and paperback on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

Until next Friday. Keep coding smartly
