In 2018, I wrote my first words online.

I had no idea what to do and how to do it. I just Googled how to get better at coding and found "start a blog."

After procrastinating for a couple of days, choosing a name and a theme for my blog, I dumped a bunch of words into a file and hit Publish.

After years of trial and error, my analytics grew from 10 visitors a month to 1,000 visitors and I made my first $100 by pure luck.

But if I had to start all over again, here are 10 actions I'd take:

## 1. Think of my online presence as a business

Writing online was just something cool I did on the side of my 9-to-5.

For so long, I only thought my online presence would make me appear "attractive" to recruiters and hiring managers. I didn't know our online presence is our most valuable asset.

Our personal brand is our own one-person business.

## 2. Start on a social blog like Medium or Quora

[I started a blog]({% post_url 2020-07-18-HowIStartedBlogging %}) because it was the only free advice I found.

But the thing with blogs is that our content is at the mercy of search engines, SEO, and their bots. Social blogs have a "feed" and algorithm to match readers with content. And that's the best way to get faster feedback as a writer.

As a coder, I'd start in a social blog like dev.to or Medium, sharing [TIL posts]({% post_url 2025-04-10-TilPosts %}).

## 3. Use a social platform like X or LinkedIn

I only started on LinkedIn 4 or 5 years after starting my blog.

And I only shared links to my posts, pretending to steal LinkedIn users for my blog. Instead, I'd use X or LinkedIn to test ideas, share nuggets of my long-form content, and grow a newsletter. Speaking of which...

## 4. Start a newsletter from day 1

Subscribers are the real metric to track. Not followers, likes, or comments.

They are our true fans. From day 1, I'd invite readers to [join my newsletter](https://fridaylinks.beehiiv.com/subscribe) at the end of every post and I'd email them weekly.

## 5. Use consistent user handles

Oh boy! I used to think hacker-like user handles, like Napster, Codemaestro, or Neo were cool.

Instead I'd use a more professional user handle across all platforms.

## 6. Go for volume first

I only wrote on my blog when I thought I had something to say.

That was once in a blue moon. And when [I started on LinkedIn]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}), that was once a week. It's no surprise I only saw traction when I went for volume.

If I were to start again, I'd [go with volume]({% post_url 2025-03-17-VolumeWins %}): 30 long-form pieces and at least 100 short-form posts to get the juices flowing.

## 7. Come up with a simple content plan

For so long, I only wrote when I had something to say. No content plan.

But to fix that, I'd send one or two long-form emails to my newsletter, and repurpose them into one daily short-form post every week. That's [the simple content plan from millionaire creators]({% post_url 2025-06-01-DanKoe %}).

## 8. Find ways to monetize earlier: courses/ebooks/templates

Making money from my online presence was an afterthought. I didn't even know I could make money online.

To start again, I'd come up with monetization strategies after the first or second month. For example, I'd package my best-performing content into an ebook or a course and put a price tag on it somewhere like [Gumroad](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/).

Those first few dollars would motivate me to keep creating and fund higher-quality products.

## 9. Only after #1-#8, buy a domain and start a website

I've built my presence on rented land. Ooops!

And when I tried to buy a domain under my name, it was already taken. It turns out there's a famous soccer player, a singer, and a film director with my same first and last name. Arrggg!

I'd buy a domain name, even if I didn't use it. Or to simply point to a landing page linking to my newsletter and my other accounts.

## 10. Invest in courses, training, and coaching

Six years passed before I bought [my first writing course]({% post_url 2024-12-26-WriteDaily %}).

Of course, I had consumed a lot of YouTube content to learn about SEO and blog post writing. But those were only two skills I needed to learn to make my online presence a real business.

I'd invest more in education to save myself a lot of time and take all the money I was leaving on the table. Well, it's never too late to start again and invest in our online presence and turn it into something real.
