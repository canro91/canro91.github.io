Junior-me was obsessed with syntax.

Ten years ago, coding only meant learning languages. I was learning C#, keeping up with PHP, and sneaking into Python. I thought coding was only about symbols and lines of code.

But to grow as coders, you need more than learning syntax and typing symbols. Here are 7 unconventional ways to grow as a coder:

**#1. Detach yourself from your code.** You'll write simpler code and become a better teammate. You'll let others touch, critique, and work on your code.

**#2. Reinvent the wheel to learn.** It forces you to read, dissect, and really understand code. Try rebuilding one of your favorite libraries and tools. Just to learn, once you've understood how they work, stick to the real one.

**#3. Do on-call at least once.** Being paged after hours isn't a pleasant experience. But you'll learn to triage, debug, and stay calm under pressure. And more importantly, to [communicate with non-technical people]({% post_url 2024-11-15-TalkingToNonTechies %}).

**#4. Watch House M.D.** This isn't a TV show about coders or hackers, but about doctors. It's a masterclass in problem-solving. You'll see how they tackle complex problems until they find a solution. More useful than most coding classes.

**#5. Learn to write.** Not lines of code, but clear, direct prose. Writing sharpens how you present ideas and solutions. That's [why every coder should write]({% post_url 2024-11-08-WhyWriting %}). And it's no surprise the higher up you climb the ladder, the less it's about coding and the more about communication.

**#6. Start and monetize a side project.** A side project will teach you:
* Marketing and sales
* How to think like a builder
* Hosting and the Cloud aren't free
* [End users don't care about clean code]({% post_url 2025-03-15-CodingForTwoAudiences %})

**#7. Learn polite ways of saying no.** You'll need this a lot. You will have to say no to unneeded complexity, scope creep, and [burnout]({% post_url 2025-03-22-IsBurnoutInevitable %}).

If you want to stand out as a coder, you need more than mastering syntax. Nobody ever taught me that starting out.

That's why I wrote _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding,_ the roadmap I wish I had on my journey from junior to senior. Because the best coders don't just type. They collaborate, build, and solve.
