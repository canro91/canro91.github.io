title: "Day One Without Social Media: What I Learned"
tags: misc experiments
---

_Yesterday I began an week-long experiment: [no social media, no feeds]({% post_url 2026-02-15-NoFeeds %}). I'm writing this at the end of the first day of the experiment._

Here's what I noticed after one day without social media:

**#1. Start with an intention.** Usually before working, I check my email and log into Medium and other accounts to reply to comments. Today I didn't need a website blocker since I started with an intention: _no social media._

**#2. Read more.** I filled the slot before working with a book. I picked _Financial Freedom_ by Grant Sabatier. Then after lunch, instead of scrolling, I kept reading another book. Yes, I read more than one book at once—One strategy to [read more books]({% post_url 2025-04-28-OneBookAWeek %}).

**#3. Time for side projects.** With the extra time, I worked on [my February book project]({% post_url 2026-02-01-BookExperiment %}). [The first draft is ready]({% post_url 2026-02-09-FirstDraft %}). And after a day's break, I'm now editing it.

**#4. An alarm as reminder.** The other day, I found out about [the 3-alarm method]({% post_url 2024-12-18-3Alarms %}). I'm using it to remind me of a "Do Nothing" time to [embrace boredom]({% post_url 2026-02-03-Boredom %}).
