It all starts with the job description.

No job description? Red flag.

_"We're looking for a passionate coding ninja to join our family. We work in an agile and fast-paced environment. We're looking for a coder with 5 years of experience who can work on our public web page, mobile app, backend, frontend, DevOps, security, compliance, sales, marketing, documentation...Compensation based on experience and interview results."_

I'm making that up, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a "real" job description like that one out there.

Passionate, coding ninja/superhero/master, family, fast-paced, high pressure...Nothing screams danger more than those words in a job description. Run, Forrest, run!

After reading between the lines of the job description, look at the company website.

"We're a family." That was the opening line on the careers page of a company someone tried to refer me to. I stopped reading. I didn't need to look at anything else. It was a hell no. That was a blinking danger sign with sirens.

Ironically, every company claims to offer excellent conditions, and every applicants seems to be the perfect candidate for the job.
