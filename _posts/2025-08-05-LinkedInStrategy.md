title: "My Simple LinkedIn Strategy for Growth (Ignoring All Gurus' Advice)"
tags: writing
---

Since January 2024, I've been growing my LinkedIn account.

As soon as you join the creator crowd on LinkedIn, you step into the gurus' land with all kinds of advice:
- Comment more: Comment for 1 hour a day.
- Don't schedule your posts: Always hit "Post."
- Engage in the first hour to "warm up" the algorithm.

Follow the gurus' advice, revealed after exclusively deciphering the algorithm, and you'd end up offering comments to the LinkedIn gods, writing your post of the day, and then commenting for another 1 or 2 hours under top creators' posts to beg for their attention.

After [writing over 300 posts]({% post_url 2025-06-15-LinkedIn %}), I've decided to ignore all those pieces of advice.

Instead, I batch and schedule my posts, and only engage to support fellow creators. And, I also make sure to reply to any comment on my posts.

Because you don't have to play by anyone's rules or follow anyone's revealed secrets. You have to come up with [an easy and sustainable strategy]({% post_url 2024-12-14-Consistency %}) to show up consistently. And that's true not just for LinkedIn, but for any creative pursuit.
