_This post is part of [my Advent of Code 2022]({% post_url 2022-12-01-AdventOfCode2022 %})._

It has been more than 10 years since I started working as a Software Engineer.

I began designing reports by hand using iTextSharp. And by hand, I mean drawing lines and pixels on a blank canvas. Arrggg!

I used Visual Studio 2010 and [learned about LINQ]({% post_url 2021-01-18-LinqGuide %}) for the first time those days.

Then I moved to some sort of full-stack role writing DotNetNuke modules with Bootstrap and Knockout.js.

In more recent years, I switched to work as a backend engineer. I got tired of getting feedback on colors, alignment, and other styling issues. They're important. But that's not the work I enjoy doing.

If I could start all over again, these are four lessons I wished I knew before becoming a Software Engineer again.

## 1. Find a Way To Stand Out: Make Yourself Different

Learning a second language is a perfect way to stand out. I'm a bit biased since [language learning]({% post_url 2020-10-23-ThreeLanguageLessons %}) is one of my hobbies.

For most of us, standing out means learning English as a second language.

A second language opens doors to new markets, professional relationships, and job opportunities. And, you can brag about a second and third language on your CV.

After an interview, you can be remembered for the languages you speak. "Ah! The guy who speaks languages."

## 2. Never Stop Learning

Let's be honest. University will teach you lots of subjects. Probably, you don't need most of them and the ones you need you will have to study them on your own.

You will have to study books, watch online conferences, and read blog posts. Never stop learning! That would keep you in the game in the long run.

But, it can be daunting if you try to learn everything about everything. "Learn something about everything, and everything about something," says popular wisdom.

Libraries and frameworks come and go. Stick to the principles.

## 3. Have an Escape Plan

There is no safe place to work. Period! Full stop!

[Companies lay off employees]({% post_url 2023-08-21-OnLayoffs %}) without any further notice and apparent reason. You can get seriously injured or sicked. You won't be able to work forever.

If you're reading this from the future, ask your parents or grandparents about the year 2020. Lots of people lost their jobs or got their salaries cut by half in a few days. And there were nothing they could do about it.

Have an escape plan. A side income, your own business, a hobby you can turn into a profitable idea. You name it!

Apart from an escape plan, have an emergency fund. The book "The Simple Path to Wealth" calls emergency funds: "F-you" money. Keep enough savings in your account to avoid worrying about when to leave a job or when the choice isn't yours.

## 4. Have an Active Online Presence

If I could do something different, I would have an active online presence way earlier.

Be active online. Have a blog, a LinkedIn profile, or a professional profile on any other social network. Use social networks to your advantage.

In the beginning, you might think you don't know enough to start writing or [start a blog]({% post_url 2020-07-18-HowIStartedBlogging %}). But you can share what you learn, the resources you use to learn, and your sources of inspiration. You can learn in public and [show your work]({% post_url 2020-10-01-ShowYourWorkTakeaways %}).

Voil√†! These are four lessons I wished I knew before starting a software engineer career. Remember, every journey is different and we're all figuring out life. For sure, my circumstances have been different than yours, and that's why these four lessons.

In any case, "Your career is your responsibility, not your employer's." I learned that from [The Clean Coder]({% post_url 2020-06-15-CleanCoder %}).
