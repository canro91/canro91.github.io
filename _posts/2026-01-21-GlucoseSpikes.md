title: "Why You're Still Hungry After Eating—And How to Fix It"

Right after lunch today, I was already craving a snack.

I usually don't eat between meals. But today, I had to eat a cup of kefir with sunflower seeds. Minutes later, I had a slice of cheese. And I was still hungry.

But that started a few hours earlier at lunch. I ate too many carbs. Rice was the culprit. I couldn't resist. Where I live, eating rice is almost a national sport. 

The reason behind that is glucose spikes.

## Glucose Revolution

After eating carbs or sugar, our glucose levels rise. Our body produces insulin to lower them. Then the crash comes. We feel tired, irritated, and hungrier.

And when we feel hungry, we grab unhealthy snacks, causing more spikes. And the cycle continues. That's why I was hungry earlier today. Chances are, you’ve felt the same..

I'm not new to glucose spikes. Learning to control them has been [my best productivity hack]({% post_url 2024-12-30-BestProductivityHack %}).

My sister read _Glucose Revolution_ by Jessie Inchauspé first and shared tips I started applying.

Finally, I picked up the book too. [I started reading it last year]({% post_url 2025-12-31-Books %}).

## Easy hacks to reduce glucose spikes (starting with the easiest ones)

Here are some of the hacks I'm following to keep glucose spikes under control:

1. Eat a salad (or some greens) with every meal.
2. Eat salad first, then proteins, then carbs. In that order.
3. Move your body after eating. Take a walk or do some squats. But move!
4. Say good-bye to sugar. If ego is your enemy, sugar is your arch-enemy. It's the devil.
5. Eat as many greens as carbs. A hamburger has the right ingredients, but in the wrong amounts.
6. Drink water with apple cider vinegar 30 minutes before lunch.
7. Prefer salty snacks over candy or sweets.

The book explains each hack with research. I won't pretend I remember all the details. Greens first makes your body absorb fiber first, slowing down carbs absorption.

If you're looking for a 20/80 rule, follow #1 and #2. That's how I dropped from ~80KG to ~74KG in a couple of months and now I don't drag my feet to get over my afternoons.
