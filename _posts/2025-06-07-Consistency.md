The hardest part of being a new writer isn't writing, but writing when nobody is reading.

For me, it took me years before I saw my first 1,000 blog visitors. And when [I revived my LinkedIn account]({% post_url 2024-12-02-FearOfPublishing %}) in 2024, it took me over a year for my first post to finally go "viral."

Those first months feel like shouting into the void. No likes, no comments, no followers. Nothing.

But to see results, we have to push through that phase. Here are 5 actions to try to keep showing up in those hard moments:

**#1. Have a clear goal (or an anti-goal).** Sometimes knowing what you don't want is more powerful than knowing what you do want. For most of us, it's the side gig that keeps us from going back to corporate cubicle.

**#2. Join a community or find a buddy.** It's easier to keep showing up when there's someone walking the same path next to you. Someone who encourages you and gives genuine feedback.

**#3. Develop a habit.** Find a time and place to practice your craft. And [make the commitment to show up]({% post_url 2024-12-14-Consistency %}), even if that means staring at a blank page. Write or create for yourself, [go for volume]({% post_url 2025-03-17-VolumeWins %}), and focus on improving your craft.

**#4. Celebrate every small victory.** Screenshot every extra like or new follower and revisit them when you feel like breaking the chain.

**#5. Find someone to make proud or jealous. Or to prove wrong.** From the E-Myth Revisited, entrepreneurs aren't the ones who start most businesses, but frustrated employees. Maybe to prove to their boss that they could create a better business, or to make an ex jealous. Sometimes, the best motivator is hearing "You can't do it" and proving them wrong.
