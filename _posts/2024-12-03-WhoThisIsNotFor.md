It's more important to ask who this isn't for than who this is for.

Who isn't this course for? Who isn't this coaching program for? Who isn't this blog post for?

I created a Udemy course on unit testing, one of my favorite subjects. I answered who this course is for on the landing page.

One student said some parts were too advanced. He had just started with the subject and my course covers more advanced material. It wasn't for him.

So I asked for feedback. What were those challenging parts? There's room for improvement there. Extra lessons and better lesson descriptions.

And I quickly updated the landing page to show who this course isn't for. That will attract fewer students but the right ones. The ones my course is really for.

Whatever you're doing, answer who this isn't for.
