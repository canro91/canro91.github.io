Feel free to build these two ideas. I'm not afraid to share them. [I'm an idea machine]({% post_url 2024-11-05-IdeaMachine %}). Steal them.

**#1. A browser extension to avoid hitting "Post" or "Publish."** Not to stop me writing, just to avoid clicking Post instead of Schedule. Handy for Medium or LinkedIn or any other content platform.

It's the second or third time I've sent an email meant for the next day. I clicked on Post instead of Schedule. Arrggg! Nothing wrong happened. I just don't want to appear in people's inboxes like a desperate creator, begging for money.

**#2. A simple online app (or page) with a target count of bullet items.** Recently, I found the 100 thoughts challenge (write 100 thoughts in less than 20 minutes). Credits to [Iban Van der Zeyp](https://medium.com/@ibanvdz) on Medium.

To finish that challenge, I thought of [The Most Dangerous Writing App](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app). You set a word count or time limit and if you stop typing before you hit that target, it erases everything. Gone! Forever. What about something similar with a target bullet point count? And each double Enter adds a new bullet point to the list.

Maybe those two are good weekend coding challenges to play with AI. If you build one, I'd love to hear about it.
