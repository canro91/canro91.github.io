I spent five years in college learning to code.

A stupid dissertation delayed my graduation. But that's another story.

Most of my five-year program didn't prepare me for real-world coding. My real coding journey began at my first job, with one Google search: _"how to get good at coding."_

I found a lot of conflicting advice:
* "Use comments"
* "Don't use comments"
* "Do this"
* "Don't do that"

Arrggg!

It took years of trial and error to learn what worked.

I had to survive on-call shifts, talk to stakeholders, and say "no" politely. More importantly, I had to learn that coding takes more than just syntax. 

That's why I wrote **Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding Without Losing Your Mind,** so you don't have to go down the same rabbit hole.

I wrote it for every developer who's ever typed "how to get better at coding" into Google or ChatGPT, just like me back in my first job.

## Inside "Street-Smart Coding"

Some lessons inside _Street-Smart Coding_ are conventional.
Others were learned the hard way.
And a few are weird.

One of the tips will save you from staying at work until 3:00 a.m. That's on _Chapter #21_.

Another tip is to watch a TV show. And no, it's not Mr. Robot or Silicon Valley. That's on _Chapter #29_. It will teach you about problem-solving.

But all the tips and lessons are battle-tested.



These are the lessons I wish I had starting out, the lessons I learned over ten years through plenty of mistakes. Now they're yours.
