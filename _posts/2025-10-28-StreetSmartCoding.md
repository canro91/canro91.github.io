title: "I'm Launching Street-Smart Coding: 30 Lessons to Help You Code Like a Pro (the Roadmap I Wish I Had Starting Out)"

I spent five years in college learning to code.

A stupid dissertation delayed my graduation. But that's another story.

Most of my five-year program didn't prepare me for real-world coding. My real coding journey began at my first job, with one Google search: **"how to get good at coding."**

I found a lot of conflicting advice:
* "Use comments"
* "Don't use comments"
* "Do this"
* "Don't do that"

Arrggg!

It took years of trial and error to learn what worked.

I had to survive on-call shifts, talk to stakeholders, and say "no" politely. More importantly, I had to learn that _coding takes more than just syntax._

That's why I wrote **Street-Smart Coding**— a roadmap of 30 lessons I wish I had when I started. For every dev who's ever typed “how to get better at coding” into Google or ChatGPT. (Back in my days, I didn’t have ChatGPT... Wait, I sound like a nostalgic grandpa...)

## Inside "Street-Smart Coding"

This isn't a textbook. It's a battle-tested guide for your journey from junior/mid-level to senior.

Some lessons are conventional.

Others were learned the hard way.

And a few are weird.

One lesson comes from a TV show. Nope, not _Mr. Robot_ or _Silicon Valley_. That's on _Chapter #29_. It will teach you about problem-solving.

You'll learn how to:
* Google like a pro
* Debug without banging your head against a wall
* Communicate clearly with non-tech folks

...and 27 more lessons I learned over ten years of mistakes.

Now they're yours.
