I've tried resolutions. But they didn't work.

On New Year's Eve, excitement fills the air: holidays, dinner, and presents. But that excitement often becomes a to-do list we never complete.

[Instead of resolutions and to-dos]({% post_url 2025-01-11-DitchingTodos %}), I prefer to go with an intention.

Last year, my intention was _"health."_ I did something for my body, mind, and spirit every day. [One simple idea that changed my life]({% post_url 2025-07-03-LifeChangingIdeas %}). A 15-min workout session, writing, and a moment of silence kept me sane.

For this year, I'm making _"simplicity"_ my new intention. And to start, I'm decluttering my digital life. Here's my decluttering plan:

## Computer

**#1.** Before messing with anything, **run a backup**. It doesn't have to be complicated. Plug in a USB drive and copy what you want to keep. I use [FreeFileSync](https://freefilesync.org/) to automate backups.

**#2. Keep the Desktop clean.** All those temporary files looking for a folder: Gone!

**#3. Clean the Downloads folder.** Remove all those freebies you never read.

**#4. Archive unused files from Documents.**

**#5. Uninstall unused software.** If you haven't used it in the last 6 months, it's out.

**#6. Delete old backups.**

**#7. Archive notes you no longer need or have already used.**

**#8. Remove screenshots you don't need anymore.**

**#9. Clean your RSS reader.** Unfollow dormant blogs or sites.

**#10. Clean your password manager.**

**#11. Discard one-time coding projects or folders.**

**#12.** Alternatively, **run BleachBit, CCleaner, or similar apps.**

_For each browser..._

**#13. Remove bookmarks.** I often use bookmarks as a cheap "Read for Later" app.

**#14. Clear browser history, cookies, and saved data.**

**#15. Remove or change pinned tabs.**

**#16. Uninstall extensions you don't need.**

## Online

**#17. Turn off email notifications.** I don't need an email for every like, comment, or repost. Leave email for 2-factor authentication or security notifications.

**#18. Unfollow people from social media accounts.** If they haven't published anything in the last 6 months, out. If their message doesn't resonate anymore, out.

**#19. Clear saved content from social media apps**, like Medium, LinkedIn, or dev.to.

**#20. Delete old email notifications.** My bank sends me an email every time I buy something. If I still need them, I can generate a report from the bank's website.

**#21. Unsubscribe from newsletters.**

**#22. Archive reference emails.**

**#23. Clean Canva projects.** Often I create multiple versions of the same design, but only the latest matters.

## Phone

**#24. Clean the homepage.** Leave no apps or icons there. Group related apps inside folders on the second page.

**#25. Remove social media and unused apps.** Again, run the 6-month test.

**#26. Remove memes and large files from WhatsApp groups.**

**#27. Remove "bad" photos.** People in funny poses, with closed eyes: gone!

**#28. Remove to-watch or to-read notes.**

**#29. Clean your browsers' history.**

**#30.** If you use YouTube, **clean your search history and change Google's Ads ID.**

**#31. Clear Cloud storage.** I keep extra copies when sharing files between computers.

I thought about making a checklist on [Gumroad](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/), but that would just add clutter to your downloads. Instead, bookmark this post.
