A post on social media convinced me to quit it for a week. Ironic, right?

The other day, a LinkedIn connection shared that _"we don't owe the Internet consistency."_ It was an invitation to disappear from social media without apologizing.

That's what I'm doing this week.

To [cut phone time]({% post_url 2026-01-22-LessScrolling %}) and [embrace boredom]({% post_url 2026-02-03-Boredom %}), I'm quitting feeds for a week. That's Medium, LinkedIn, dev.to, YouTube...

Quitting feeds frees up between 45-60 minutes each day. Yes, that's how long I scroll down feeds on average, even when [using social media consciously]({% post_url 2026-01-19-LinkedIn %}). Every time I open a social media app, I remind  myself: _"creators don't consume."_ A reminder to [spend time making]({% post_url 2026-02-14-SomethingYouLike %}), not scrolling.

Even though I'm disappearing, I've scheduled posts so my system runs without me.

I'm planning to use that extra time to [read books]({% post_url 2025-09-08-StoicBookReading %}) and finish [my February book experiment]({% post_url 2026-02-01-BookExperiment %}). I will share the results soon.
