I first encountered the concept of Repurposing from the Content10X podcast. It opened a whole new world for my content. This is how I've repurposed my content.

**Content Repurposing means presenting a piece of content into different formats to target separate platforms or audiences. Often, text content is repurposed into graphics, quotes, and video.**

## How to deal with Content pressure?

One piece of advice for content creators is to write consistently.

But, trying to write consistently brings the question of what to write about next. And, we start to feel the pressure of writing content instead of enjoying the process.

These are two things I've tried to combat content pressure:

1. **Create a Content Calendar.** Write content in advance and stick to a schedule I could sustain in the long run. For example, I publish every other week on my blog, and I have posts ready to publish weeks, even months, in advance.
2. **Repurpose content.** Writing original content for every online platform is time-consuming. Instead, convey the same message in formats suited to each social media platform. Link from your repurposed pieces back to your main content. It will attract more readers.

## How to repurpose blog posts?

I stopped simply reposting most of my content. This is how I've repurposed some of my posts.

I turned long posts into [dev.to](https://dev.to/canro91) digests. I turned a series of posts into an ebook.

I created a course from a long post. I turned a couple chapters from that course into smaller posts to promote the course itself.

I made LinkedIn posts and updates out of sections from my posts.

For example, about my [Unit Testing 101 series]({% post_url 2021-08-30-UnitTesting %}), I turned one post into a 3-part series. After that, I added spin-offs, prequels, and sequels to my existing posts on unit testing. I wrote an "index" post with references to all posts in the series. I came up with an entire season out of a few posts. 

And, lastly, I created a best-of post from my [most viewed posts from 2021]({% post_url 2022-01-10-BestOf2021 %}).

Voilà! That's how I have used the concept of repurposing. I changed my blogging approach, from writing about anything whenever I had an idea to a consistent schedule of related topics. Definitively, I saw an increase in traffic and backlinks without paying even a dimme for it.

If you're curious about my writing journey, check [how I started blogging and why you should start too]({% post_url 2020-07-18-HowIStartedBlogging %}) and my takeaways from [Show Your Work]({% post_url 2020-10-01-ShowYourWorkTakeaways %}), a book that inspired me to keep writing, even when nobody was reading.

_Happy writing!_
