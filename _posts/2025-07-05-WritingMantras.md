In 2018, I wrote a blog post for the first time.

I didn't know what I was doing. I only wanted to get better at coding. And after years of trial and error and taking my writing seriously, I've developed my own writing mantras. Here they are:

**#1. If it can help one person, you're safe to hit post.** Write about anything, as long as it's helpful for at least one person. You don't need to write to the masses. [Just to one person]({% post_url 2024-12-24-WritingVoice %}). And that one person could be your past self.

**#2. Give something and give it fast.** Writing online is different from fiction writing. In a novella, you can describe every detail of the room where your scene is happening. But online, readers decide in milliseconds if they'll keep reading or move on. [Nail your headlines]({% post_url 2025-06-05-IrresistibleHeadlines %}) and [opening lines]({% post_url 2025-05-09-BleedInTheFirstLine %}).

**#3. Write as if nobody is reading, and keep writing because you don't know who's reading.** Writing can be lonely, especially at the beginning. The cure? Write for your younger self. Write the tweets, posts, or books you would have liked to read two years ago.

**#4. Don't wait to become an expert to write. Write to become one.** If you wait to become an expert, it will take you 10 years or more to write your first piece. Instead, share what you're learning. [Show your work]({% post_url 2020-10-01-ShowYourWorkTakeaways %}). The best way to learn is to teach, and the best way to teach is to write.

**#5. An intention makes you start but a system keeps you showing up.** It's easy to start. Just drop a bunch of words into a text box and hit "Post." The hard part? Doing it for years. For that, find a system to capture ideas and turn them into content, and one piece into many.

In the end, it isn't just intention. It's the right attitude, a system, and the habit that keeps you writing.
