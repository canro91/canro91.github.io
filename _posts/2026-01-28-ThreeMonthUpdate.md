title: "An Update After Three Months of Launching Street-Smart Coding"

Three months ago, I launched my first book, _Street-Smart Coding_. A persistence test.

It wasn't my first, but the first I was confident enough to call a book. It challenged my persistence. I even wrote chapters in a hospital while supporting a loved one. Chapter 17 is one of those. Sometimes I avoid rereading those chapters.

## Some lessons, realizations, and hard-truths

Writing a book taught me many lessons:

**#1.** [Interior design is not that hard]({% post_url 2025-09-22-WritingABook %}). Reedsy does the heavy lifting. Or you can find your way with Word and a lot of Googling.

**#2. Instead of a massive launch, think of a series.** That's [the best promotion strategy for your first book]({% post_url 2025-09-30-PromotingABook %}).

**#3. Set a deadline.** A task can take as much time as we give it. Writing a book isn't the exception. It took me about 4 months to finish the first draft. Here are [more lessons nobody told me about writing a book]({% post_url 2025-11-16-LaunchingABook %}).

**#4. Once your book is out, the game starts in your head.** That's the fear of finding typos or getting bad reviews. That's refreshing your sales dashboard and comparing your book to others. [Here are more realizations]({% post_url 2025-11-22-HardTruthsWritingABook %}). Just focus on what you can control: work on the next one.

**#5. There's always something you could have done better.** Once it's out, it's out. Your job was to write it, your audience's job is to read it. Again, work on the next one.

## I'm doing this differently

By no means, I'm an expert book writer. I only have two under my belt. But here's what I'd do differently.

**#1. Start backwards.** Start with a promise, cover, sales page, and outline. That forces you to clarify your book promise and message.

**#2.** [Come up with a one-liner]({% post_url 2025-11-09-OneLine %}). That's to summarize the core ideas and to make promotion easier.

**#3. Pre-sell it earlier.** "Do good work and people will come" is a lie.

I once read an ebook called, _Start Marketing the Day You Start Coding_ by Rob Walling. It was about building SaaS startups, but the idea works for books too.

With a clear promise, cover, and sales page (following #1), start promoting from day one.

**#4. And I'd order my author copies from Amazon earlier.**

## Some numbers

I offer _Street-Smart Coding_ as an eBook via [Gumroad](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=three-month-update), and in Kindle and paperback formats in [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Street-Smart-Coding-Better-Without-Losing/dp/B0G64PG9NP).

Here's a breakdown of copies sold:
* eBook version: 51 sales. +2 in Spanish edition
* Kindle version: 1 sale.
* Paperback version: 1 sale.
* "Door-to-door" sales: 8 copies. (7 Spanish, 1 English).

For me, even one sale beyond friends and acquaintances meant success. That's enough motivation to keep writing.
