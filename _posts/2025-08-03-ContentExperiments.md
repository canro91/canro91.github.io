title: "7 Fast Content Experiments I'm Running This Month (to Make a Buck or Two)"

Recently, I learned about the 10,000 experiment rule.

I found it on [Skip The Line]({% post_url 2025-05-27-SkipTheLine %}) by [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}). That is, instead of aiming for 10,000 hours to mastery, run quick, cheap, and easy-to-do experiments.

Yesterday, as part of my daily routine of writing 10 bad ideas a day, I thought about experiments I could run this month. So here are 7 of them.

**#1. Change my LinkedIn bio to include "Ghostwriter."** Often the only thing we need to start with a new offer or service is changing our headline and email signature. I'm changing my LinkedIn headline and bio to start my LinkedIn ghostwriting gig.

**#2. Upload my coding courses to my Gumroad store.** I offer three C# coding courses on Udemy. The thing is, Udemy keeps students contacts and takes a big cut.

Instead of growing Udemy's business, I'm hosting my coding courses on [my Gumroad store](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/) too. I control the course prices and have direct access to my students.

**#3. Change all prices on my Gumroad store to end on 99.** There's a lot of psychology research behind pricing. Long story short, products with prices that end in 99 sell more. Let's see if that's true.

**#4. Instead of giving away some ebooks, charge $1.** Or $0.99 to follow #3. I've read that $0.99 is the new free for books, given that "free" readers rarely convert to paying ones.

**#5. Reformat my free ebooks and point to my paid ones.** I'll add a "From the same author" section to each book.

**#6. Increase the suggested prices of all my free products.** I offer free books on Gumroad, with pay-what-you-want pricing. I only set a suggested price. I'm increasing that price from $5 to $7. Maybe I can subconsciously influence my visitors to leave a higher tip. Muahaha!

**#7. Offer all my C# coding courses on a "C# Fundamentals Bundle."** After following #2 and #3, I'm bundling my C# courses together and offering it for $12.99 or something. If I sell one or two bundles, that's a win!

Let's see which ones take off. Either way, I'll learn something... and keep my daily streak alive.
