title: "What I Gained After 6 Years Blogging on dev.to"
tags: writing
---

Six years ago, I wrote my first blog post... and heard crickets.

Nobody was reading my blog. I wanted some traffic there. [Some attention]({% post_url 2025-06-16-BloggingExpectations %}). I was playing the SEO game with keywords and answer posts. I prayed to the SEO gods to send readers to my blog.

Those days, I found out about [dev.to](https://dev.to/canro91), the new platform in town for coders.

A better way to get readers? Create an account and repost there. So on July 23rd, 2019, I did it. I didn't know where it would take me.

## Some vanity metrics, before I move on.

In six years, I've written 176 posts.

Some of them are dev.to "originals." Others reposts. I wrote more posts, but I deleted the oldest in a moment of embarrassment. Yes, even I cringed at reading them. They were so bad.

My posts on dev.to have received +114K views and 1.6K reactions. And I have +25K followers. Mostly bots or inactive users I think.

## But dev.to didn't just send traffic.

Where was I? OK, what my dev.to account has done for me...

**#1. It's helped me connect with other members of the community.** I've had virtual coffees with other "devtoers."

**#2. It's given me confidence in my writing skills.** I went from deleting some posts in embarrassment to being featured in the Top7 more than once. That's a sign my writing has improved. A win for [taking my writing more seriously]({% post_url 2025-04-16-WritingChanges %}) since last year.

**#3. It's put my content in front of an audience.** Last year, [I burned out]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}) and [got laid off]({% post_url 2024-12-05-HowALayoffFeels %}). Writing was my therapy. So I started to share my career stories and lessons. Writing helped me process [a rejection from a FAANG]({% post_url 2024-05-27-ApplyingToFaang %}), for example. Seeing my posts resonating with a lot of people was so encouraging.

**#4. It gave me a small moment of virality.** Thanks to dev.to, I went viral for the first time ever. With this post: [This Is Why We Don't Test Private Methods](https://dev.to/canro91/this-is-why-we-dont-test-private-methods-28ef).

In a single day, I got thousands of readers and dozens of downloads from [my Gumroad account](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/). Shameless plug. Someone reshared it or it got syndicated somewhere. Dunno. I felt like an Internet coding celebrity... just for a few hours.

**#5. It's given me a chance of giving back to the coding community.** It's helped me turn my stories into inspiration and some laughs for others. Like the best comment I've received: _"Made my day go from brain-f\*cked to f\*cking good."_ That made my day and reminded me why I keep showing when it feels nobody is reading.
