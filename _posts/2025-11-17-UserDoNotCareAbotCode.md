Last week, one of my LinkedIn posts sparked a heated discussion.

I shared [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iamcesaraguirre_youre-not-senior-just-for-knowing-yet-another-activity-7393663762291007489-uwKs) about what makes us senior coders. Its point was to build real products instead of [obsessing over syntax]({% post_url 2025-10-21-BiggestMistake %}).

I shared,

> ... true seniority is when you:
> - Stop obsessing over syntax
> - Realize end users don't care about your code
> - Understand coding is collaboration and communication

Most people agree with the message, except for this line:

> "End users don't care about our code."

Some take "end users don't care about code" as permission to ignore quality and standards. That's wrong.

But there's also the "end users don't care about code," so:
* Let's stop fighting over languages and tools
* Let's stop building excessive abstractions
* Let's stop [making it scale]({% post_url 2025-05-17-NeedForScale %}) just in case
* Let's choose boring technology

End users suffer the consequences of poor coding practices. Sure! It shows up in buggy, slow apps. Nobody wants that.

What matters to users is speed and reliability, not whether we used jQuery or React. They care about whether we solve their problems.

[We write code for different audiences]({% post_url 2025-03-15-CodingForTwoAudiences %}): for end users, future coders, and business owners. And they don't care about the same things.

Being senior means meeting the needs of all three groups.

For so long, I thought coding was only typing syntax. That realization inspired me to write _Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding,_ a roadmap to help you move from junior or mid-level to senior without losing your mind. It's the roadmap I wish I had starting out.
