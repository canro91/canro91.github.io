If you're not new to writing online, you've heard blogging is dead.

And there's some truth behind that. Social media has killed blogging. Google doesn't like personal blogs anymore. It's regurgitating AI answers. That made me change [my writing strategy]({% post_url 2025-01-27-TimesOfDeadBlogging %}), by the way. My blog isn't the only place I show up anymore.

Personal blogs are still alive...in a small corner of the Internet. The problem is discovering them.

If Google's bots don't crawl and index your blog, your posts will sit there forever, waiting for visitors. That's not the case with social media. Just open your account and scroll your feed. And boom! Content is there!

## These days, while looking at my analytics, I discovered out a "feed" for blogs: minifeed

[Minifeed](https://minifeed.net/about) is "a curated blog directory, reader, and search engine."

Its goal is to collect personal blogs and make them discoverable. No AI or algorithms behind the feed, just human curation.

Yesterday, I scrolled through minifeed's feed and went down the rabbit hole of personal blogs. Here are my favorite posts:

#1. [A photo of a big door](https://maique.eu/posts/2025-03-26-a-big-door). This is from a photographer running a plog, a photo blog. Did I just invented a new Internet word?

#2. [A diagram of feline feelings](https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/03/feline-feelings/).

#3. A software engineer who [changed his mind about AI](https://arslan.io/2025/03/26/i-was-wrong-about-ai-coding/).

#4. A reflection on [time passing](https://herbertlui.net/the-time-will-pass-anyway/).

#5. A developer who learned about [nonograms](https://hanki.dev/nonograms/). Imagine a sudoku marrying a crossword, but instead of putting numbers in cells, you have to color them. Definitely, I'm giving them a try.

#6. A writer who decided to stop writing down ideas because [good ideas always come back](https://nik.art/important-ideas-will-come-back/). Well, I need to write them down to tell my brain "it's OK, we already did something about it. Back to sleep." I also discovered another daily blogger.

#7. A post on [why requests to fire people are often rejected](https://staysaasy.com/saas/2025/03/26/owning-firind.html).

#8. Someone using [music as a pain reliever](https://bobmonsour.com/notes/music-as-a-pain-reliever-post-op/) after getting his knee replaced.

#9. And of course, my own post with [tips to read code]({% post_url 2025-03-26-ReadCode %}). Shameless plug.

If you want to go down the rabbit hole of personal blogs, try [indieblog.page](https://indieblog.page/) to get a random post or [searchmysite.net](https://searchmysite.net/) for a search engine of personal blogs, [ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory), or [blogroll](https://blogroll.org). Blogging isn't dead yet.
