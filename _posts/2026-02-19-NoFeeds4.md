title: "Day Four Without Social Media: Real Connection"

On my fourth day [without social media]({% post_url 2026-02-15-NoFeeds %}), I noticed how email has reshaped my morning.

I know I should [protect my sacred hours]({% post_url 2025-07-16-ProductivityTips %}) by staying away from distractions first thing in the morning. Anyways...

Checking my email for health insurance paperwork changed my mood. And soon I was thinking about my book pages stats and sales. They're not a feed, but as addictive as social media. I lost track of time checking stats.

Avoiding feeds was easier when I closed my laptop and went to a cafe to chat with my family. It wasn't just coffee. And by choosing a local cafe, we supported our community over major chains.

We embraced social media's promise of connecting us via the internet. But we've forgotten to truly connect in real life.
