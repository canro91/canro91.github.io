[With a book coming out]({% post_url 2025-09-21-30Ways %}), my next question is how to promote it.

## The obvious strategy

The first (and maybe obvious) strategy I've found is to share everything about it.

Share when the first draft is done, the edits you left out, the book cover ideas, some excerpts, and the reviews you get. Even I found the idea of a guy who wears a "Ask me about my book" t-shirt when he goes to conferences and networking events to promote his books.

Share anything and everything about your book.

## The surprising strategy

But apart from making noise, I found a surprising strategy:

Write a second or a third book.

[James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}), one of my favorite writers, teaches that strategy in his podcast, posts, and course. "The best way to promote a book is to write another book." Because when you like a book, you want to binge-read all other books from the same author.

That happened to me. By accident, I found [one of James Altucher's books]({% post_url 2025-01-19-ChooseYourselfGuideToWealth %}) and [I almost devoured all of them]({% post_url 2025-05-27-SkipTheLine %}). So the strategy works. It worked with me. And that's proof enough.
