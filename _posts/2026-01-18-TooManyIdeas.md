One problem is having no ideas. Another is having far too many.

With endless options, which project comes next?

That was one of the questions Austen Kleon, author of [Steal Like an Artist]({% post_url 2025-11-08-StealLikeAnArtist %}), got in [this interview](https://youtu.be/AvUELPpj63s?t=3616). An audience member with "millions of ideas" and "29 books to write" asked how to find time for them.

Her struggle resonated with me. Because these days, I'm like her. I have too many books and projects to choose from.

But here's what I've been trying when I feel overwhelmed by ideas:

**#1. Write down every idea as it comes.** A book title, a concept, or just a phrase. Don't let them go away.

**#2. Create distance from your ideas.** Take some time to do something else. This space helps your brain to connect the dots.

**#3. Choose wisely.** Tackle the project you can finish the fastest or the one you're most excited about.

Credits to my sister for helping me think this through.

Currently I'm at phase one: brainstorming with [10-idea lists]({% post_url 2025-03-23-BecomingAnIdeaMachine %}). Meanwhile, I'm giving my brain space to make connections by doing nothing. I know there's a book in there. I'm trusting the process.
