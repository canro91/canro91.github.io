It wasn't a time management technique. It wasn't the Eisenhower Matrix, Eat That Frog, or the Pareto Principle.

It was an energy management technique: eating better.

## Eating better. Eating for energy.

Eating better means no processed foods, no carbs, and no sugar. We all know we should eat better. Nothing new! Right?!

But from "Glucose Revolution" by Jessie Inchausp√©, eating better means reordering how we eat, without sacrificing those delicious candies.

Salads first. Proteins and fats second. And carbs and sweets last.

## Reordering how we eat keeps our glucose spikes under control

Glucose spikes are the reason why we feel tired all day and hungrier even after eating. We have too much sugar in our bloodstream.

Simply by reordering how I ate, I got my energy back:
* I don't get sleepy after lunch.
* I don't drag my feet to get through my afternoons.
* I lost ~4kg in two months without much effort.

Also, to control our glucose spikes, we could walk for 10-15 minutes after eating. The longer, the better.

Thanks to my new diet, my afternoons are as productive as my mornings. No more feeling like a zombie at the end of the day.

We are what we put in our bodies. And if we eat well, we think well.
