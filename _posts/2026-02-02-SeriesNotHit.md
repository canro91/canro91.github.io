_"Is there a next part? Are you covering the next stage after being a good coder?"_ a friend texted me.

He finished [Street-Smart Coding]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}), my first book, and was eager for more. A reminder of a marketing lesson I had forgotten.

_The best way to promote your book is by writing another one._

I first heard [this surprising strategy]({% post_url 2025-09-30-PromotingABook %}) on James Altucher's podcast.

Nicolas Cole, author of _The Art and Business of Online Writing_, teaches the same strategy.

On his YouTube channel, he advises building a portfolio of books instead of chasing one big launch. When readers finish and enjoy your book, they want more. One single title after a big launch doesn't meet that need.

That's what happened to my friend after reading my book. And that's more encouragement to work on the next one.
