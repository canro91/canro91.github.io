Hey there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. Being a good tech leader isn't about knowing all the answers. Here's [how a good leader leads a room full of expert](https://idiallo.com/blog/how-to-lead-in-a-room-full-of-experts) (7min). I loved this piece so much that I wrote a reaction post.

#2. Ten years ago, the junior me wanted to optimize every line of code. Newbie mistake. I wish I had found this guide with [9 things every graduate should know about performance](https://johnnysswlab.com/9-things-every-fresh-graduate-should-know-about-software-performance/) (5min).

#3. Hey this is kind-of a pitch, but the new coding gig is [vibe-coding clean up](https://donado.co/en/articles/2025-09-16-vibe-coding-cleanup-as-a-service/) (6min). It doesn't sound that bad.

#4. Without getting into politics, here's a breakdown of [how it's like using online services from a "banned" country](https://gist.github.com/avestura/ce2aa6e55dad783b1aba946161d5fef4) (6min). Well, from that posts I learned about a HTTP response code.

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [the first step for reinvention when we feel lost]({% post_url 2025-09-23-Reinvention %}) (2min) and I reacted to [how to lead in a room full of experts]({% post_url 2025-09-24-Leadership %}) (3min).
