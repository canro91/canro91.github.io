I'm writing a book backwards.

Technically, it's [a mini-book]({% post_url 2025-12-27-MiniBookModel %}). I'm turning a hit post into a book.

In the spirit of [doing 10,000 experiments]({% post_url 2025-05-27-SkipTheLine %}) and to [keep running content experiments]({% post_url 2025-09-16-ContentExperiments %}), here's what I'm doing this month:

**#1. Repurpose a hit post.** I'm turning one of my most read and liked posts into a short book. Over 100 people liked that post. Proof that the idea works. I'm even naming the book after the post.

That's what the authors of _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck_ and _The Psychology of Money_ did.

**#2. Find inspiration from comments.** My hit post got a decent amount of discussion. I'm using those comments to find keywords, taglines, and objections.

**#3. Expand it.** The source post is a 7-point listicle. I'm turning it into a 10-chapter concise book, like [Steal Like an Artist]({% post_url 2025-11-08-StealLikeAnArtist %}). Each point expands into one or two pages with stories and past posts.

**#4. Write it backwards.** Instead of jumping to the introduction, I'm:
* Choosing a title
* Writing [a one-line summary]({% post_url 2025-11-09-OneLine %})
* Outlining the content
* Finding Amazon keywords and categories
* Sketching a sales page

I'm even stealing cover ideas before writing a word.

**#5. Make it short.** The other day, I found [a one-page book]({% post_url 2026-01-14-TheShortestBook %}), so why not write 10 or 15 pages and call it a book? One or two pages per point plus the front and back matter.

**#6. Price it incrementally.** I'm following the "$0.99 is the new free" idea. If it gains traction, I'll raise the price by $1 every other month until it hits $5.

**#7. Hit one reader milestone.** Just like I set it for [Street-Smart Coding]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}), if even one reader beyond my circle buys it, the experiment is a success.
