"If I had more hours, I'd build more things."

Anyone else feel that? Or that's just me?

I've wanted to quit my day job more times than I can count.

I stopped thinking about quitting when I discovered the idea of a daily creative block.

## Two hours are enough to create evergreen content.

Mark Thompson works for 2 hours.

He's a veteran marketer who now creates for a living. He replies, posts, and runs a community. All in about 2 hours every day.

About working for just 2 hours, [he wrote](https://seriousmarketersonly.medium.com/two-hours-of-work-evergreen-income-00e7a50f6127),

> _Two hours of focus work today can create a lifetime of income tomorrow._

That was [one of the lines that made me think recently]({% post_url 2025-11-15-LinesThatMadeMeThink %}).

## A professional writer doesn't write for that long.

Mark isn't the only one with that routine.

Steven Pressfield, author of _War of Art_, follows the same practice.

In an interview in Huberman Labs, he shared that he only writes for...guess how long? Two hours. After that, it's time for interviews, marketing, and promotion.

If pros write only for two hours, we don't need to quit. We need habit and discipline first.

Austen Kleon said it in [Steal Like an Artist]({% post_url 2025-11-08-StealLikeAnArtist %}), _keep your day job_. I stole his idea of checking a box every time I work on my projects. That's my plan for 2026 and the years to come.

You just need two hours. Start today. The time to quit will come later.
