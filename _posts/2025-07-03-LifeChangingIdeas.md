## #1. If you feel lost in life, start by working on your health.

Last year, for the first time, I had no idea what to do with my life.

I had just recovered from a stomach sickness. I was on my way out from a burnout season. And a layoff caught me off guard. No side income, no next offer waiting for me. No plan B.

I felt more lost than when I graduated high school. At that time, I believed in the "go to college, find a job, work hard" path in front of me. But this time? I realized that the default path was a lie. 

By accident or luck, I found the idea of working on my health when I felt lost. And it worked. Slowly, it gave me clarity and momentum.

Truth is, to change our lives we don't need "passion" or a big master plan. We just need to start working on our health.

## #2. Do something for your body, mind, and spirit every day.

After deciding to work on my health, I ditched my to-do list and focused on one single goal: working on my body, mind, and spirit every day.

I found that idea in one of James Altucher's books. Probably Choose Yourself.

For me, it meant a workout session, writing 200 words, and a moment of silence every single day.

For you, it could be going running, meditating, or painting. Whatever. But do something for your body, mind, and spirit every day.

We're truly healthy when the three of them are healthy. Work on each one every day. That's the easiest recipe for a happy life.

## #3. Save 50% of your income

Credit goes to an ex-coworker from my first job.

One day, out of the blue, he came close to my desk and shared this unsolicited advice. For free.

He told me:

> "Cesar, imagine you only make half of your salary. Save and invest the other half. Sooner rather than later, you will buy your own house."

That's the best piece of advice I've ever received.

## #4. Learn a second (or third) language

I learned English to make my CV attractive and land high-paying jobs.

But learning English meant more than high-paying jobs. It opened a whole new world: friendships, traveling, books... And you're reading this because one day my mom's best friend told her to sign me up for English classes.

For me, it was English. For you, maybe Arabic for work in the Middle East or Spanish to join a rising startup in LatAm. A new life is waiting for you behind a new language.

## #5. If you don't read, you won't learn anything.

I don't remember much of my philosophy class in high school.

But I won't forget our teacher's mantra. He repeated it all the time. "If you don't read, you won't learn anything."

Many years later, I stumbled upon him at a mall and told him I still remembered his quote. He told me the second part: "If you don't read, you won't have anything to talk about." I had to wait more than 10 years to learn the full line. 

Read one page or 10 or 15, but read something every day.

## #6. Start a blog

Apart from learning English, writing is one of the most helpful skills for my professional career.

I made my first $100 online by sharing my words in a corner of the Internet.

Start a blog or write tweets. Just write. It will teach you to think clearly and it can make you some money in the meantime.

## #7. The minute you learn something, teach it.

I found this idea in "Show Your Work" by Austen Kleon.

You don't need a lecture hall or scientific papers to teach. Simply share it with anyone over the phone. Or write it anywhere online. That's what has powered my online presence since I wrote my first blog post back in 2018. Sharing what I learn has not only helped others, it has changed my own life.
