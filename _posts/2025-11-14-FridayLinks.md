Hey there. Here are 4 main links plus 2 extras I thought were worth sharing this week:

**#1.** I'd give my junior self lots of advice. But if I had to choose one, I'd say [always be ready to leave your job](https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-11-08-always-ready-to-leave/) (6min), even if you're not planning to leave.

**#2.** I once tried being full-stack, until I discovered the backend world: RESTful APIs and DDD. Maybe [being a full-stack coder is a myth](https://dev.to/adamthedeveloper/a-full-stack-developer-is-a-myth-3bmk) (10min) after all.

**#3.** Here's a quick take on [why polymorphic tables aren't a good idea](https://zarar.dev/the-temptation-of-polymorphic-tables/) (3min).

**#4.** Could strict best practices and clean code create [an unhealthy culture](https://dev.to/elvissautet/we-need-to-talk-about-how-toxic-dev-culture-has-become-and-how-we-fix-it-1gi1) (10min)?

And two quick ones, just for fun:

**#a.** I had my first laptop full of stickers. If you're like the old me, share your laptop stickers on [stickertop.art](https://stickertop.art/main/).

**#b.** It seems we coders aren't the only ones copy-pasting from ChatGPT. [Journalists do it too](https://x.com/omar_quraishi/status/1988518627859951986)

And in case you missed it, I wrote on my blog about [8 steps to take over a legacy codebase]({% post_url 2025-11-13-LegacyTakeOver %}) (5min) and [when AI feels like cheating]({% post_url 2025-11-11-Cheating %}) (2min).

_(Bzzz...Radio voice)_ This email was brought to you by... _[Street-Smart Coding: 30 Ways to Get Better at Coding](https://imcsarag.gumroad.com/l/streetsmartcoding/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=friday-links-leaving-jobs-full-stack-myth-stickers)_. From Googling to clear communication, it covers 30 lessons to help you code like a pro. It's the roadmap I wish I had moving from junior to senior, and the one I hope helps you too.

See you next time,

Cesar
