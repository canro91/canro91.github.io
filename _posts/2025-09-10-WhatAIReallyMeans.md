AI is the new buzzword of the day.

Add "AI" to a company or product name to join the hype. It's all over the news. [AI is the new contender for coders]({% post_url 2024-04-29-2034Predictions %}). Yes, we coders are always the ones being replaced.

But Ibrahim Diallo made a good point in his post [AI is Not a Technology, It's a Subscription Company](https://idiallo.com/blog/ai-is-a-subscription-company):

Swap "AI" for "subscription company." And [all AI those headlines]({% post_url 2024-12-08-CEOVsJanitor %}) make more sense. _"%X of code at $BigTech is generated by a $SubscriptionCompany"_ has a new meaning.

AI isn't a product we own. It's subscription companies profiting off our data. And that isn't innovative or disruptive at all.
