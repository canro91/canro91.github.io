title: "6 Lines That Have Made me Think Recently"

I've reduced the media I consume. I've stuck to books and podcasts while doing the dishes, and occasionally a few forums and indie bloggers via Minifeed.

From those few sources, these lines have made me think recently.

**#1. AI won't take your job. It will change your job description.**

**#2. The rich have money, the wealthy have time.**

**#3. Don't be the best, be the only.**

Those three come from Kevin Kelly, the guy behind the 1,000 true fan concept. I've been listening to [this podcast interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKba_awaAkk). I don't know how many dishes I need to wash to finish it.

**#4. Hands first, then computer.** This is a line I found on [Steal Like an Artist]({% post_url 2025-11-08-StealLikeAnArtist %}). Computers have disconnected us from doing art with our hands.

**#5. Momentum isn't doing more, it's doing less, but better.**

**#6. Two hours of focus work today can create a lifetime of income tomorrow.**

This comes from Mark Thompson, a veteran marketer I've been following recently. I've used [Mark's Sales Funnel method]({% post_url 2025-10-11-ContentThatSells %}) to [promote my new book]({% post_url 2025-10-28-StreetSmartCoding %}).
