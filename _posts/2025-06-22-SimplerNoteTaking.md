For a long time, I was a note-taking freak.

I spent hours trying to find the perfect note-taking system. I tried a bullet journal, a simple A-4 sheet of paper folded twice, and [an endless .txt file]({% post_url 2020-08-29-HowITakeNotes %}). I probably have an old comparison table of note-taking buried in my old computer.

## Starting a second brain

Years later, probably scrolling on Hacker News, I found out about the Zettelkasten method.

It fascinated me so much that I read [How to Take Smart Notes]({% post_url 2020-11-18-HowToTakeSmartNotes %}) to learn more about the method and started my own "zettel." But recently I realized that I barely revisit most of my notes. I'm not interested in the same topics anymore.

## Simply writing 10 ideas

And after reading some of [James Altucher's books]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}) and [recovering from burnout]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}), I've changed my mind about productivity and to-do lists.

Instead of to-do lists and goals, I've started to write 10 ideas a day to [become an idea machine]({% post_url 2024-11-05-IdeaMachine %}). It has changed my note-taking habits too. Now, after every book, podcast, or course, I write down 10 key lessons. It forces me to recall the main ideas from the content I consume. I don't need to write every single detail but rather remember the 10 points that resonate the most. That effort makes the learning stick.

I still write down the quotes I like the most from books I read. But I've stopped chasing second-brain systems and testing every new AI-powered app. I simply write 10 ideas. It's simple and more useful than any system I've tried.
