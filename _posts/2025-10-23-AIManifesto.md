On August 27th, 1997 the world as we knew it changed: Skynet became self-aware.

That was almost 30 years ago. Maybe Terminator 2 wasn't just a movie, but a documentary. Who knows? But while we wait for nuclear destruction, humanity's extinction, or simply UBI, here's my statement on how I use AI:

## I use AI for coding (but with some rules)

After a few days with AI, [I was becoming dependent]({% post_url 2025-07-13-TheProblemWithAI %}), even for simple tasks.

That's why I don't recommend [new coders rely on AI]({% post_url 2025-09-15-ShouldIUseAI %}) to generate code, but use it as a learning aid. And that's also why I've put some rules: [AI stays outside my editor]({% post_url 2025-10-14-AIRule %}).

I don't swear by AI. [It's far away from replacing coders]({% post_url 2025-04-25-WillAITakeMyJob %}). But [coding will look different in 10 years]({% post_url 2024-04-29-2034Predictions %}).

That's for coding. But for writing, my approach is different.

## Zero AI for writing

I write every word here and elsewhere. All of them. By a human. Me.

I use AI to proofread and edit my words. [I've replaced Grammarly]({% post_url 2025-03-01-ReplacingGrammarly %}) (at least the basic, free version) with a simple prompt.

I used to make posts eye-catching with AI-generated images of humanized cats doing everyday tasks. Who doesn't like cats? But after [changing my approach to blogging]({% post_url 2025-01-27-TimesOfDeadBlogging %}), I stopped using images and covers on my posts. So no more AI cat images.

When social media and the whole Internet get flooded with soulless, dull AI-generated content, I'm also in the small crowd standing up with stories, an authentic voice, and a message worth reading.

I'm in the "if you don't care to write them, why should I care to read them?" team. We don't need another AI-generated post starting with "In today's world..."
