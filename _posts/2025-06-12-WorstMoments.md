title: "10 Life-Changing Lessons I Learned the Hard Way—from the Worst Moment of My Career"

Two years ago, my life sucked. Completely. I felt like a complete loser.

In 2023, I got sick. One day, out of the blue, I started to rush to the bathroom after every meal. And it wasn't to throw up.

By the end of 2023, I burned out. And in 2024, I was laid off. A simple call over Microsoft Teams ended my 5-year career at a company.

I felt so lost. I felt more lost than when I was a teenager out of high school trying to figure out life as an adult.

That was the worst moment of my career and probably of my life. But that whole situation taught me these 10 lessons:

## 1. Your health and well-being are more important than any job.

When I burned out, I had stopped working out, running, and eating healthy.

I was so focused on my career that I had forgotten about resting and taking care of my health. It was a painful mistake.

Remember you can always get a new job and a new career, but not a new body.

## 2. You're more than your job title.

For years, my career was probably the most important part of my life.

My job was what brought me a sense of accomplishment, fulfillment, and joy... until I heard a "We have to let you go" on a call. It shook my world because I had wrapped my entire identity around a title: "Software Engineer." It became all I thought I was.

Remember, [diversify your sources of joy and fulfillment]({% post_url 2025-01-07-DiversifyYourJoy %}).

## 3. Build multiple sources of income like your life depends on it.

No job is safe.

I used to think being an employee was the safest route. I don't know who made me believe that. I was so wrong. Being an employee is like having one single customer who can decide to stop buying from you at any time.

Don't only rely on your paycheck. Have more than one way to make money.

## 4. The moment you stop learning and growing, it's time to go.

For months and years, I delayed the decision of finding another job or starting my own thing. Being at a "good enough" job was the most expensive decision for my career.

## 5. Do something that brings you joy every day.

It took me months, probably one entire year, to [feel free from burnout]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}). The path was simple but slow: going back to my hobbies and practicing them every day.

## 6. Your connections and online presence are way better than a CV.

Right after the layoff, I felt relieved. No more meetings or emails.

But after a few weeks, I went into panic mode. I realized no paycheck was coming. I applied to anything with "software engineer" in the job description. [I took the CV route]({% post_url 2024-10-07-TipsToWriteBetterCVs %}). And I don't have to say it led me nowhere.

When [the layoff season came]({% post_url 2023-08-21-OnLayoffs %}), I didn't have a solid network and I had set aside my online presence. Your brand is your CV and portfolio.

## 7. Be careful with what you put in your body and mind.

Apart from pills, to recover from my stomach sickness, I had to eat fruits and vegetables, at a fixed schedule, and eat them slowly.

To recover from burnout? It started with an information diet.

I cut news, music, podcasts, TV shows, movies.... I only focused on binge-watching Borja Vilaseca, a Spanish YouTuber with an inspiring story of personal and professional reinvention.

## 8. Change and reinvention start in your mind.

It was a little voice in my head that made me start again.

"If you don't get up by yourself, nobody else will do it for you." Maybe it was all the inspiring YouTube videos and books I had started to consume.

You have to choose yourself first. Always.

## 9. Listen to your body for small clues.

I didn't wake up burned out. It was a slow process on the way down.

Now that I connect the dots, there was a clear sign I failed to notice: not wanting to get out of bed. My body was yelling and I ignored it.

## 10. Your current struggles will become lessons and stories to share.

After more than one year, I could say I'm free from burnout.

But just thinking of where I was makes me anxious again. That's my best motivation to keep working today. I thought I wouldn't make it. Being healthy and doing something I love felt like a distant goal I would never reach.

No storm lasts forever. Your current struggles will become lessons and stories to share. Like the French say: "Après la pluie, le beau temps." There's always sunshine after the rain.
