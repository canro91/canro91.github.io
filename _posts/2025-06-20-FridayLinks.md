Hey,

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. I don't know how many times I've had to flip the conditions inside an if. Maybe not my trickiest bugs, but still... Anyway, here are [9 lessons from a coder's trickiest bugs](https://henrikwarne.com/2025/06/15/lessons-from-9-more-years-of-tricky-bugs/) (8min).

#2. [This coder doesn't use AI and explains why](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me) (8min). One of his main concerns? Speed.

#3. [Google Translate hasn't killed translators and interpreters](https://ingrids.space/posts/what-google-translate-can-tell-us-about-vibecoding/) (6min). Maybe AI won't kill coding either. At the end of the day, we as coders are translators too.

#4. It feels like coders will be AI's first victims. But [this might be the best time to learn software development](https://greenbluegray.substack.com/p/now-might-be-the-best-time-to-learn) (8min). Well, some time ago it was with textbooks, StackOverflow, forums, and instruction manuals.

I've been playing with Copilot recently. It's already saved me hours of repetitive work. And in case you missed it, I've written about the tasks Copilot has helped me with [here]({% post_url 2025-05-24-CodingWithAI %}) (3min) and [here]({% post_url 2025-06-19-CodingWithAI %}) (2min).
