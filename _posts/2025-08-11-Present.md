By the end of 2023, I had burned out.

I had tied my sense of purpose to my job while forgetting my health and hobbies. That took a toll on me.

To recover, I started with an information diet. No more mindless scrolling, Hacker News, or even music. Just talks from creators who have been through it. [Borja Vilaseca](https://borjavilaseca.com/) was one of them.

Another inspiring figure was [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}). I read about his bankruptcies and how he bounced back. I started to follow one of his habits: doing something for my mind, body, and spirit. He calls it: [The daily practice]({% post_url 2025-01-11-DitchingTodos %}).

Since recovering, I've embraced a simple mantra: one day at a time.

No matter how tough the day is, trust God (or the Universe or Life) and rest. Tomorrow is a fresh start.

[Stop time traveling]({% post_url 2024-12-19-TimeTravel %}). Because living in the past makes you resentful, and worrying about the future makes you anxious. Stay present.
