title: Three Language Lessons I Learned on my First Visit to France

This post is about learning new languages. But, not programming languages. Foreign languages.

I want to share three lessons I learned while traveling to France to practice my French speaking skills. Each lesson is behind a funny story that happened on my first visit to France.

One of the three lessons is to **learn vocabulary to suit your own needs**. If you're traveling for work, vacations or exchange, you will need vocabulary for different type of situations. I learned this lesson while waiting at the security in an airport. _Can you imagine what happened?_
