"In the realm of..." "In the world of..." "In our fast-paced world"

AI-generated content floods the Internet. And it'll only get worse as AI tools become better.

That's not new. We've had mediocre content flooding the Internet since always with spam and posts playing SEO schemes.

I write on dev.to, and I still find posts full of keywords pretending to rank higher in the search results. SEO is dead. Well, that's what everybody claims these days.

We have to choose our battles.

And we'll lose the one against AI-generated content. Every day we have more and better AI tools that generate mediocre content in seconds. A 1,000-word post? Beep, beep, boop. Boom! Here you have it!

If you're writing anywhere online, complaining about AI-generated content won't do anything. Complaining in general doesn't do anything.

From [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %}), one of my favorite writers, I've learned that:

> "If AI can write it, you need to rewrite it."

If you want to stand out in an ocean of AI-generated content, you have to do what AI can't do yet: add your personal touch, experiences, anecdotes, stories, and bad jokes. You have to make your content more human. [You have to find your voice]({% post_url 2024-12-24-WritingVoice %}).

AI is going to kill mediocre writers, but it'll make good writers stand out.
