title: "The Only Goal That Matters for Every New Digital Writer"

My first blog post was a word vomit.

I wrote long sentences and paragraphs. I dumped a bunch of words on a page. That was what I thought writing was. I only knew fiction writers who described every detail of a room in a novel. I didn't know writing for the Internet was a different game.

That's the mistake of every new writer.

Today, while reading a Hacker News submission about how cringe-worthy LinkedIn posts can be, I found [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46073892) that captures this problem:

> _The highest level of cringe you can feel is when you see people you know well in real life post on LinkedIn. The contrast between the way they speak in real life and on LinkedIn is often immense, you don't feel that level of contrast with random internet strangers._

"I'm pleased to announce..."

"I'm excited to share..."

"Dear LinkedIn network:"

You wouldn't say those words in real life. So why use them anywhere online? To impress? To sound corporate?

If you're writing online, the real goal isn't to sound like a "real" writer. [There's no such thing as real writing]({% post_url 2025-08-26-RealWriting %}), by the way. Your goal is to make readers hear your voice.

Record your voice or [write inside WhatsApp]({% post_url 2025-03-05-WritingVoice %}). Let your true voice speak. That's the only goal that matters.
