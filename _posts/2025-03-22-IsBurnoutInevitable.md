In 2023, I burned out.

I checked all the boxes for the first time. The burnout boxes. It wasn't a good thing. And it took me almost [an entire year to recover]({% post_url 2025-01-04-RealizationsFrom2024 %}).

I know I'm not the only one, of course. It's all over the tech industry.

In recent weeks, I've been exchanging emails with another senior software engineer who went through a burnout season. His take? The tech industry is unsustainable.

These days, I've been chatting with a group of colleagues and friends. Most of them claimed to experience some sort of boredom at their jobs. OK, boredom isn't burnout, but it's a warning sign.

We're privileged to work in the tech industry.

But, it has its own challengesâ€”YMMV, of course:

* We work long hours.
* Coding is mentally exhausting.
* AI threatens us to take our jobs.
* [Layoffs are always around the corner]({% post_url 2023-08-21-OnLayoffs %}).
* Agile and SCRUM take control away from us and trap us in "ceremonies."
* We're problem solvers at heart, but often [we don't get to solve problems]({% post_url 2024-11-18-CodersDontSolveProblems %}).
* We're expected to code after hours just to prove we're "passionate." Side projects and open source contributions.
* We have high standards for quality and development practices. But stakeholders' expectations don't align ours. They care about different things.

The toll? Our mental health. Burnout.

The solution? I don't have one.

Yesterday I found on the front page of Hacker News a post about [tech being a burnout machine](https://unionize.fyi/) and unionizing as the solution. Mmmm. Dunno.

My best idea? Detach our sense of meaning from our jobs, recognize [there's nothing wrong with coding just to pay the bills]({% post_url 2025-01-15-CodingJustForMoney %}), [set boundaries between work and non-work]({% post_url 2025-03-03-Boundaries %}), and [diversify our sources of joy]({% post_url 2025-01-07-DiversifyYourJoy %}).
