title: "The Surprising Lesson from My First Online Writing Class"

This year, and for the first time since University, I took a writing class for the Internet.

It was a webinar, to be precise. Tim Denning and Todd Brison ran it.

The main lesson? Write daily. Daily?! Yes, daily.

That was shocking. I was used to writing on my blog when I felt I had something to say. Usually, once a month. Later, when I gained some traction, twice a month. I only wrote daily when I challenged myself to [write ~20 posts before Christmas in 2022]({% post_url 2022-12-01-AdventOfCode2022 %}).

To write daily, you don't have to produce 1,000-word posts each time. A good headline and one main point are enough to hit "Publish." Even a tweet, a quote, or 200 words are a good place to start too.

When you write daily:

1. You make people notice you and remember you by consistently showing up in their feeds.
2. You get closer to your future customers, bosses, and partners. Remember, people don't buy from or do business with random people on the streets, but from people they know.
3. You build a library of content that showcases your expertise. People will see you as an expert, or at least someone who knows about the subject you're writing about.

Write your first piece to get ahead of those who never start, and keep writing daily to get ahead of those who quit along the way. Your future self will thank you for it.
