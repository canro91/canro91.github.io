Hey, there.

Here are 4 links I thought were worth sharing this week:

#1. PHP was my first love. I spent countless hours coding a recipe catalog using CodeIgniter to learn coding. To my surprise PHP just turned 30. And after 30 years, PHP has become [the Toyota Coralla of programming](https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-toyota-corolla-of-programming/) (9min).

#2. It's easy to spot AI-generated posts. Just look at the opening sentence. Look for anything like "In today's fast-paced world." But what about code? Here's [how to know when someone is vibe coding](https://alexkondov.com/i-know-when-youre-vibe-coding/) (3min).

#3. Reading code is an underrated coding skill. These days of too much vibe coding, reading code is the forgotten skill. If vibe coders only [read the f*ing code](https://etsd.tech/posts/rtfc/) (9min).

#4. What's the secret behind success? It seems [passion has a lot to do with it](https://birming.com/2025/07/27/passion-as-the-recipe-for/) (2min).

And in case you missed it, this past week I wrote on my blog about [how programming is becoming prompting]({% post_url 2025-08-06-Prompting %}) (2min) and [7 life events that deserver a "shower" too]({% post_url 2025-08-04-BabyShower %}) (2min). That last one was half-joking. But the business shower doesn't sound that crazy.

Last week I found out a Brazilian YouTuber translated one of my posts and reacted to it on his channel. [I share the video here]({% post_url 2025-08-02-StandOut %}). Funny things that happen.
