[You can't fight against it]({% post_url 2025-02-15-FightingAIContent %}).

Recently, I learned how to stand out from AI while listening to [James Altucher]({% post_url 2024-11-11-LessonsFromJamesAltucher %})'s podcast. I forgot to [take notes]({% post_url 2025-06-22-SimplerNoteTaking %}), but he said something like this,

AI only remixes content it was trained on. AI can't beat an authentic voice with impactful stories. We have to live our stories and pour them into our writing.

My writing resonated more once I started sharing personal stories. They turned [my writing from crickets to likes]({% post_url 2025-04-16-WritingChanges %}). So tell stories only you can tell. That's how you truly stand out from the noise.
