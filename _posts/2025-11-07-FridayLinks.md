Hey there.

Hope your week's been good. Here's what caught my eye lately:

**#1.** Around this day in computing history, [the Morris worm infected 10% of the Internet](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/on-this-day-in-1988-the-morris-worm-slithered-out-and-sparked-a-new-era-in-cybersecurity-10-percent-of-the-internet-was-infected-within-24-hours). A prank that got out of control. Thank goodness that worm is trapped in a floppy disk now. Do you still remember floppy disks?

**#2.** Amazon has been in the headlines: outages, layoffs, and users leaving its cloud. Maybe [the could wasn't such a great idea](https://rameerez.com/send-this-article-to-your-friend-who-still-thinks-the-cloud-is-a-good-idea/) after all (20min). And I don't need to worry about the fear of missing the cloud hype.

**#3.** I don't miss Scrum and its "ceremonies" from the corporate world. [The whole Agile movement has become a performance theater](https://dev.to/pascal_cescato_692b7a8a20/actually-agile-against-performance-theater-in-software-development-1ohi) (6min). We get stuck in rituals instead of real work. Arrggg!

**#4.** As a coder, I'm grateful for free and open-source software (FOSS). But it rarely beats the convenience of most closed software. Often [FOSS scares "normal" people](https://danieldelaney.net/normal/) (3min).

Also on my blog this past week, I share about [AI's hidden gift]({% post_url 2025-11-01-AIGift %}) (2min) and [the real problem with AI writing all our code]({% post_url 2025-11-03-AIProblem %}) (3min).
