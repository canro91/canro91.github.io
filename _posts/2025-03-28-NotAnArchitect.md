Has this also happened to you?

[You're in a meeting]({% post_url 2025-03-02-SmootherMeetings %}) discussing a technical issue or a bug. After many ideas, you share yours. But it passes unnoticed.

Since there was no consensus, another meeting is scheduled. But this time with a figure of authority or expertise: an architect, director, or VP.

Surprisingly enough, they share the same idea as yours. But this time, it's considered.

That's when you say "I said the same thing, but since I'm not an architect, director, or VP nobody listened." Arrggg!

Sure, those moments are frustrating. But they earn us points in our authority and trust score.

It's not only about sharing good ideas, but how we present them and how others perceive us, just another team member or a trusted one.

That's what I call: the not-an-architect effect. A reminder that how we present our ideas is as important as the ideas themselves.
