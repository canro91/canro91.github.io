title: "I Replaced Grammarly with This AI Prompt (Tested on Copilot)"

AI is here to stay.

We can't ignore it. We can't refuse to use it. [We have to adapt]({% post_url 2025-01-21-AIAdaptation %}), or somebody with AI will replace us.

I'm not in the "Never use AI" team. In fact, I already ran the experiment of [launching a coding course with Copilot as my assistant]({% post_url 2024-03-18-AIToLaunchMyCourses %}).

But what I don't agree with is using AI to replace my thinking and writing.

That's why every single post you find here (or anywhere else online under my name) is written by meâ€”a human, not an AI. #madebyahuman

Even though, I don't use AI to regurgitate hallucinations, [a veteran coder warned me about that the other day]({% post_url 2025-02-24-AVeteranOnAI %}), I use AI to proofread and edit my posts. Here's the prompt I use:

> You're an expert on writing and editing, show the grammar and spelling issues from the next text. Fix those issues, keeping the original tone. Bold all the words you change. Only the words. This is the text:
>
> {add your text here}
>
> Don't rewrite it. Only fix the grammar and typos. Remember to keep the same tone and structure.

I tested it on Copilot. It should work on ChatGPT too. Give it a try and see if you can replace Grammarly with that prompt as well.

PS: I proofread and edited this post with the very same prompt. No robots were harmed in the making of this post.
