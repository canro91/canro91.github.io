If you work remotely, this scene will feel familiar during virtual meetings:

Someone is talking, makes a little pause. Somebody else interrupts, then the first person starts talking. A pause. Then, a "you go first," followed by a "no, no, no. You go first." Then, both of them talk at the same time. Arrggg!

Here's a trick to avoid that annoying situation:

Just like pilots or anyone using "single-channel" radio, pause for a few seconds after someone finishes speaking before you respond.

With this brief pause, you give time to the speaker to finish their chain of thoughts and wait long enough for the latency of getting the message on your side.
